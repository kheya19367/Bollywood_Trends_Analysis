She is killed accidentally by pieces of broken glass in the back of her head. Rajiv is stunned looking at the blood-soaked pillow and gulps a lot of alcohol with sleeping pills. The next morning, he wakes up to realise that everything that he was experiencing was just a dream but, as the day progresses, the events that take place in his life and the people that he comes across make him question whether what happened last night was a dream or did it actually happen. He calls his friend to check if his friend is fetching Sandy for the evening party. His friend is shocked as Rajiv was not told about it earlier. Rajiv discovers that Sandy is alive and staying at a hotel, where he calls her and asks to meet her. Sandy is the same girl he had met a few years before for his advertisement shoot and had spent the night with and forgotten.

He recollects a childhood scene where his parents fought over the dinner table and the argument ended with their separation. On the way, his car suddenly breaks down on a remote road with the engine smoking. Out of the blue, a mechanic walks up to him with a tool kit and wishes him happy birthday as he ponders the situation.

Before leaving, the mechanic murmurs him a statement and says ""Apki Sandy ready hai, sir."" Rajiv is stunned again and looks for the mechanic, but he has disappeared.

Raaz: Reboot,tt5639388,"On 4 January 2016, Rehaan Khanna and Shaina Khanna returned to Romania a few years after their marriage. They had lived there before they were married. But when Rehaan got an offer as a venture capitalist for the East European Finance Company, Shaina insisted that he take up the job. Rehaan was reluctant, since he had a secret to hide. On the very first day, while unpacking her luggage, Shaina experiences paranormal activities. Rehaan refuses to believe her. A month later, while on a business trip, Rehaan receives a frantic call from Shaina requesting for help. She is found holed up in a telephone booth in a rural area. Apparently, she had gone there to visit a clairvoyant. Thus, the narrative juggles back and forth as to what plagues them and what leads her to the clairvoyant .

The local priest tries to perform an exorcism on Shaina but fails as the spirit knows the priest's past and uses it against him to send him packing. A blind Indian student, Trilok who is studying psychometry in Romania then encounters Aditya Srivastava, rescuing his lover from the evil spirit. Aditya has a strange premonition about all the events taking place in Shaina's life. He offers to help her fight the spirit and free her from all the pain she is enduring. Although Shaina doesn't believe him at first, certain series of events make her believe that the spirit has something to do with her husband Rehaan. She finds out that he is keeping a certain secret which has now become the cause of the haunting. Eventually, Rehaan confesses that he had murdered Aditya and the latter's ghost is seeking revenge. Four years ago, just before Shaina's marriage, Aditya had called Rehaan revealing himself as her ex-boyfriend. Aditya had invited Rehaan to his residence and had blackmailed him for insider trading . Aditya told Rehaan he was willing to drop the charges if Rehaan broke off his engagement to Shaina, so that Aditya could rekindle his relationship with her. Rehaan tried to quietly leave but Aditya showed him photos of his intimate moments with Shaina and began to taunt him. Enraged, Rehaan had struck a blow to Aditya on the head, killing him. As Aditya lay dying, he vowed vengeance. The spirit of Aditya then takes complete possession of Shaina's body. To save Shaina from the evil spirit of Aditya, Trilok recites the Gajendra moksh stotra. By reciting this mantra, Aditya's evil spirit will have to leave Shaina's body, but there's a condition, that the mantra is to be recited without a pause. Though Aditya's spirit stops Trilok and Rehaan from completing the mantra, Rehaan saves Shaina from Aditya. The movie ends with Rehaan and Shaina sitting by the lakeside talking about how there was a lot of ice around their house when they had first arrived but now all of the ice has melted, symbolizing the increased closeness between the couple.

When they reach the airport in Bangkok, both rob each other, but only Chetan is successful, as he gets Bhagat's cash and expensive watch, while Bhagat gets Chetan's fake wallet with fake money and fake credit cards. The two become enemies since then. But both meet again when their eyes fall on Khushi ( Kangana Ranaut ). Chetan lies that he is a donor, who helps the needy, while Bhagat acts to be a blind man, who was once a Navy officer. Both of them play foul tricks to get Khushi, which leads to disastrous results. Later, Bhagat gets hurt in an accident with his motorbike, and claims that the shock repaired his eyesight. After a party, Bhagat, Khushi, and Chetan go to a church while they are drunk, where they meet father Pascal ( Satish Kaushik ).

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story,tt4169250,"In the pre-credits sequence there is a scene of the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final . MS Dhoni , India's captain, walks out to bat after Virat Kohli 's wicket.

The film begins in Ranchi , 7 July 1981. At the hospital maternity unit, Paan Singh Dhoni is confused whether he has got a girl or boy. He later names his baby boy Mahendra 'Mahi' Singh Dhoni. Paan Singh is a pump operator who waters the practice ground. Fourteen years later, Mahi is spotted by a cricket coach while goalkeeping in a football game. He invites him to try out for the school cricket team as a wicketkeeper and selects him after being impressed. Mahi improves his batting and becomes a regular member of the team.

Three years later, a grown up Mahi helps win an inter-school cricket match. After achieving much fame, Mahi is selected for the Ranji Trophy but his draft notice is held up due to which he is late in reaching Kolkata despite his friends' help. But Mahi does not give up and, to please his father, he joins the Kharagpur Station as a ticket collector. Years later, Mahi's sister Jayanti is married to his friend Gautam Gupta.

After some time, Mahi is depressed with his job. With the insistence of his manager, Mahi decides to play cricket alongside his work, and after his day-shifts he goes to practice cricket. He participates in different tournaments and as a result he gets selected for the Railways . After a good performance, he tries-out for the India national under-19 cricket team selections. Bihar loses to Punjab where Yuvraj Singh scores 301 and Mahi does not succeed though he is selected for the Duleep Trophy .

Mahi leaves his job and admits to his father that cricket is his only ambition and he wants to become a professional cricketer. He works hard and is selected in the national team and makes his debut. He meets and befriends Priyanka Jha, an office consultant, and scores a century after meeting her. She buys a watch for him as a Valentine's Day gift but dies in a truck accident on her way. Mahi again goes into depression and has bad form in the 2007 Cricket World Cup . As captain of the national side, he wins the T-20 World Cup, and leads India to the number one ranking in Test matches .

In 2010, Mahi arrives at a hotel. Sakshi Singh Rawat, a hotel intern (catering management student) fails to recognize him and later apologizes to him. They soon start dating and Mahi eventually proposes marriage to her after she mentions buying him a Valentine's Day's gift which he refuses. They marry and Mahi begins training for the 2011 World Cup . He eventually develops the team with new players. The film returns to the final where Mahi eases the pressure with a crucial innings. With 4 runs required, Mahi hits a six and India wins the final. His family, friends and coaches watching the match cry happy tears.

After the credits, the real MS Dhoni walks by the boundaries .

Development of a Dhoni biopic began after the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final and the discussion about the idea went on over the following years but remained dormant. Then, after a few years, Dhoni was at an airport when a child approached him and asked him a question on motivation. Dhoni sat down with the young boy and spent 5 minutes answering the question. His manager, Arun Pandey, asked why he spent that much time and Dhoni replied how his answer was pivotal in benefiting and motivating the boy. This incident then prompted Pandey to make a film about him saying [to Dhoni] that his story has the power to motivate millions of children like him. [ 10 ] After the idea coalesced, Pandey began to convince Dhoni himself in order to adapt his life into a full-length feature film. [ 10 ] When he was first approached on the idea of the adaptation, he became a little worried and questioned the need for it. But after being convinced by his peers, all he said was, ""Don't misrepresent me. Show me as I am."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ] It took Dhoni two years to finally agree. [ 10 ] According to the International Business Times , the film carried a production budget of around ₹ 104 crore (US$12 million). [ 12 ]

Pandey was attracted to Dhoni's story not because of his successful cricket career, saying that ""it's foolish to chase MS Dhoni's life story only because it's about cricket,"" but rather to instances and factors that made him the person he is today. [ 13 ] Dhoni wasn't involved in writing the script. Pandey recruited a team of researchers who collated data and background information while the director was busy directing Baby (2015). [ 13 ] The filmmakers decided that they would only green-light the film once they had a convincing story to tell after the research. [ 14 ] Pandey met with Dhoni numerous times over a span of eight months and by the eighth month of their meetings, in 2014, the main arc of the story began to form. Their first meeting took place in Delhi during a cricket match. During their sporadic meetings, Pandey chose not to record and tape their conversations which prompted Dhoni to open up more. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]

Arun Pandey says 98% of the content in the film is reality. The team undertook two years of research on the various incidents and how they took place. Pandey says ""such authenticity would be hard to find even in Hollywood ."" [ 10 ] Pandey revealed several prominent aspects of Dhoni's life that were hidden before including the fact that Dhoni initially disdained cricket and had a predilection for football instead, his signature ""helicopter shot"" was taught to him by his friend Santosh Lal, he likes women who don't recognise him, he and Yuvraj Singh had close ties even before their respective stardom and it was Dhoni who ousted Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid from the team since he wanted to build a young team for the 2011 World Cup with better fielders and he wasn't too happy with the 'fitness' levels of the aforementioned cricketers. [ 15 ]

Pandey decided to end the film with the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final since he felt ""the arc of the story had a natural high at the 2011 World Cup win."" He knew that they were chronicling almost 30 years of a sportsman's life ""in a highly compressed manner"" and said that had he extended the script to his sudden retirement during an ongoing series, the run time of the film would shoot up to six hours. [ 13 ]

Neeraj Pandey was in the midst of shooting Baby (2015) when Arun Pandey, the manager of Dhoni, offered him an opportunity of making a biopic based on MS Dhoni . However, Pandey was sceptical and didn't wish to tackle such a subject until he met Dhoni himself. It was only after meeting Dhoni personally – during the second schedule of Baby – that he was convinced to helm the film. Although, to him, he treated the project not as a biopic, but more as an inspiring story. [ 13 ] [ 16 ] Pandey admits that he is not a fan of Dhoni and doesn't feel guilty about it. But he does have a predilection for cricket and other renowned cricketers like AB de Villiers and Sachin Tendulkar . He explained how not being a fan helped him direct the movie impartially, ""I think if you are fan, as a director it would be difficult to be objective and impartial. A fan would only see positives. Even negatives will look like positives for him. So not being a fan helped me direct the movie impartially."" [ 16 ] It is the director's first biopic film. [ 13 ]

Every question that came from the director or any member of the team working on the script was directly answered by Dhoni. He would clear any doubts of the director and Rajput. [ 10 ] However, he did not want the film to serve as a whitewash of his life, ""One thing I told (Neeraj) Pandey is that this movie should not be to glorify me. It's about the journey of a professional sportsperson and that's what it should depict."" [ 11 ]

Director Pandey, who had not seen any of Sushant Singh Rajput 's films, followed his intuition when it came to casting him. Akshay Kumar wanted to play the lead role and wanted Rajput to play the younger MS Dhoni but Rajput was always the director's first choice given how both Dhoni and Rajput hail from the same part of India, which made it easy for him to get the dialect right and the fact he has a predilection for sports like Dhoni. [ 16 ] When he met Rajput and chatted with him for 15 minutes, he knew that the accent, the setting and the milieu they needed to capture would not be a problem. [ 9 ] [ 13 ] Rajput admits that he is a fan of Dhoni, and describes himself as an ""ardent"" cricket fan. [ 17 ] Rajput's sister is a professional cricketer who once made it to the women's national team, while he himself wasn't very good at the sport no matter how hard he tried, even failing to get selected for the school team. [ 9 ] [ 18 ]

He found it difficult to get Dhoni's mannerisms right. He said that he did not pretend to be Dhoni, but actually felt like the cricketer while essaying the title role. In order to prepare for his role, he had to go through an exhaustive prolonged training for a period of 18 months before shooting began and watched his videos for hours, to a point that he subconsciously started picking up some of his traits. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 19 ] For instance, in order to grasp Dhoni's trademark ""Helicopter shot,"" the team would carefully analyse it and fix the bowling machine into one spot and then play the same shot at least 200 to 300 times a day for a week to a point that it came naturally to him. [ 17 ] He also met Dhoni thrice before filming commenced. [ 20 ] Former wicketkeeper Kiran More personally coached Rajput for thirteen months, including wicket-keeping and batting before he started learning Dhoni's body language. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] He practiced for four hours, starting at 6:00 every morning. [ 10 ] Rajput described More as a ""tough taskmaster,"" who treated him like a professional cricketer rather than an actor. [ 22 ] Dhoni's batting style was scientifically analysed, learnt and practised and an analyst was called on board for this. Training sessions were recorded and compared with the cricketer's real game. It took a further six months for Rajput to feel confident that he looked and played like Dhoni. [ 18 ] [ 20 ]

The film was shot mainly in authentic and real-life locations where Dhoni spent much of his childhood and teenage years, [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 23 ] with Pandey saying that 95% of the locations in the film were authentic. [ 24 ] In an effort to stay true to the crux of the biopic, Neeraj also shot scenes from the film in Dhoni's real home in Ranchi , Jharkhand where his parents and brother Narendra currently live. Shooting also took place at Kharagpur railway station where Dhoni once worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE), his old school, Jawahar Vidya Mandir and at the quarter number 142 of Mecon Limited he shared with his four roommates while studying engineering. The filmmakers were also shown his former social hangout as well as introduced to the food he liked eating whilst growing up. [ 4 ] [ 23 ] Dhoni's real school teacher was cast in the film. [ 25 ]

Filming also took place in Jamshedpur with shots filmed at Keenan Stadium , [ 26 ] and Aurangabad . [ 27 ]

Rajput learned Dhoni's signature 'helicopter' shot by the end of the first day, but suffered a hairline fracture and had to leave for two weeks. [ 19 ]

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story received the widest release for a Bollywood film receiving a day-and-date release both in India and internationally in a total of 61 countries across approximately 4,500 screens worldwide on the week ending 2 October 2016. [ 11 ] [ 28 ]

However, the film was not released in Pakistan due to problems following the 2016 Uri attack . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Sabina Islam, media and marketing manager of the distributor IMGC Global Entertainment in Pakistan told The Express Tribune , ""We wouldn't want to release anything that can aggravate the current situation of the two countries. Dhoni is India's hero so it's risky."" [ 29 ] [ 31 ] The film was also not released in Punjabi and Marathi languages. This was because Fox had wanted to release the film on the same day-and-date but a dubbed version in the two aforementioned languages could not be produced at that time. [ 28 ]

Even though attempts were made later to dub and release the film in the Marathi language in the state of Maharashtra , [ 32 ] this was however not possible. This was because Amey Khopkar, chief of Chitrapat Karmachari Sena , the film affairs wing of regional political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena told the filmmakers that releasing the film in the language would cause unfair competition for regional movies by giving rise to a scenario where more filmmakers will release Hindi films dubbed in Marathi, prompting Pandey to scrap the plan. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]

The film was declared tax-free in Uttar Pradesh by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav a day after its release, [ 35 ] [ 36 ] and in Dhoni's home state, Jharkhand , a few days later. [ 37 ] Maharashtra was also declared tax-free on 5 October by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . [ 38 ]

The filmmakers organised large promotions, which later helped the movie register good advance booking. [ 39 ] A teaser trailer was released on 15 March 2016, in conjunction with the commencement of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 . [ 40 ] The first official poster was released on 7 July 2016, on Dhoni's 35th birthday. [ 41 ] In late September 2016, the cast flew to Chennai to promote the film where Dhoni and Rajput met veteran actor Rajinikanth at his residence and discussed the film. [ 42 ]

Maruti Suzuki released two MS Dhoni inspired special edition of Alto cars – the Alto 800 and Alto K10 – as part of the company's association with the film. The two cars were unveiled by Dhoni and R S Kalsi, Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director of Marketing and Sales in Hyderabad on 24 September. [ 43 ] As a part of the association, Maruti Suzuki ran a series of customer engagement activities on social media .

The film recouped around ₹900 million (US$13.5 million) before its release via multiple platforms and ancillary; ₹550 million (US$8.2 million) from satellite rights; ₹200 million (US$3 million) from endorsement brands; ₹100 million (US$1.5 million) for overseas distribution rights; and ₹50 million (US$750,920) for music rights. [ 44 ]

Internationally, the film was released in 60 countries across 1,000 screens in conjunction with its Indian premiere. According to Vijay Singh, that marks the biggest-ever release for a Hindi film in Tamil and Telugu and one of the widest for any Indian film internationally. [ 11 ] It was released in key markets including the United States and Canada and the U.K. and in the other regular Bollywood diaspora markets in South East Asia , Africa and Europe . Through a chain of distributors the film also went out in non-regular Bollywood territories such as Japan , Spain , France , Hungary , Poland , the Philippines and the West Indies . [ 11 ]

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story Game , a cricket sports mobile video game developed by Hungama Gameshastra Pvt. Ltd. (a joint venture of Hungama and Gameshastra) was also released a tie-in item to the film. [ 45 ]

The film was released on Friday, 30 September, across approximately 3,500 screens and delivered an opening of ₹ 213 million (US$2.5 million) on its first day, [ 46 ] occupying 45–50% of the total marketplace which is the biggest opener of Sushant's career. [ 29 ] Buoyed by positive reviews, the film earned a total of ₹ 660 million (US$7.8 million) net [ 46 ] the second biggest opening for a Hindi release in 2016 behind Sultan . [ 30 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] The Tamil version of the film collected ₹ 70 million (US$830,000) in its opening weekend in Tamil Nadu , which is the highest for a film dubbed from Hindi in the state. [ 49 ]

Following its weekend debut, the film witnessed a sharp fall on Monday earning ₹ 85.1 million (US$1.0 million) and ₹ ₹ 75.2 million (US$890,000) on Tuesday. [ 50 ] By 11 October, the film had grossed a total of ₹ 1.16 billion (US$14 million) in India [ 51 ] and is currently the fifth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2016 in India. [ 52 ]

Internationally, the film made an estimated ₹ 219 million (US$2.6 million) in its opening weekend from 60 countries. [ 53 ] It had successful debuts in many markets, including $1.1 million in the U.S., $995,000 in the Middle East, $263,000 in the U.K. where it ranked at No. 9, and $194,000 in Australia for tenth spot. [ 47 ] The film received a limited release in the U.S. and Canada across 256 theaters and earned $1,108,650 at an average of $4,331 per theater, debuting at number 14 at the box office, [ 54 ] [ 55 ] becoming the third Bollywood film of 2016 to debut above $1 million, following Sultan and Fan . [ 30 ]

The film received mainly positive reviews from critics. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 47 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]

The film was noted for omitting certain aspects of Dhoni's life and in the realm of cricket that were deemed noteworthy such as the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 press conference, where Dhoni brought the entire team and read out a statement of unity, the 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing and betting case and the alleged rift with Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir . The film also does not include Dhoni's take on the two-year ban imposed on Chennai Super Kings from playing in the Twenty20 which he captained at that time, which ultimately led to the Supreme Court asking N. Srinivasan to step aside as BCCI  President . The film also does not provide any explanation to Dhoni's purchase (and eventual sale) of the 15% stake in the player management firm Rhiti Sports, or why he was named the vice-president of India Cements . [ 4 ] [ 58 ] While the film featured his sister Jayanti, there was no mention about his real life elder brother, Narendra Singh Dhoni, who is a politician. [ 59 ] Chanchal Bhattacharya, a specialised cricket coach who used to train young cricketers in Dhoni's school campus pinpointed at a pivotal incident during Dhoni's days which was absent in the movie: Dhoni once scored a century for East Zone in a Deodhar Trophy against Central Zone . Karsan Ghavri , who was the coach of East Zone at that time, praised Dhoni's century saying that ""this lad will represent the country one day."" [ 60 ]

The Hindu said, ""of course such sanitisation makes the film lose out on interesting layers and complexity, but, curiously, the focused, unwavering eulogising of Dhoni also helps it get an unmistakeable emotional acuity."" [ 4 ] In a more positive take, Andy Bull of The Guardian said that not every aspect of Dhoni's life could be included in the three-hour-and-10-minute-long biopic. He quoted John Briley 's famous line from the script he wrote for Richard Attenborough 's Gandhi : ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime."" [ 61 ]

Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor gave a positive review of the film, praising the performance of Rajput in particular. [ 37 ] Several professional Indian sportsmen and sportswomen, such as cricketer Mohammad Kaif [ 62 ] and badminton player Saina Nehwal , [ 63 ] had high regards for the film.

Rachel Saltz of The New York Times gave a negative review of the film, saying that ""you don't have to understand cricket to enjoy a good cricket movie"", e.g. Lagaan (2001), but one does ""have to be a cricket fan, and an indulgent one at that"" for M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story . She found the term ""hagiographic"" unfit for the film and labelled the film as ""long and languid."" She concluded by saying, ""I learned more about Mr. Dhoni — his enigmatic character and what marked him as a great captain — by reading about him after watching this movie than I did during three long hours."" [ 64 ]

Amaal Mallik composed the soundtrack for M.S. Dhoni. [ 65 ] Rochak Kohli composed one song as a guest composer. T-Series acquired the music rights for the film. The 10-song album features the voices of singers Armaan Malik , Arijit Singh , Siddharth Basrur , Rochak Kohli and Palak Muchhal ; it was released in three different language versions: Tamil, Telugu and Marathi. Tamil lyrics were penned by P. Vijay , Telugu by Chaitanya Prasad and Marathi by Guru Thakur . [ 66 ] The background music was composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/M.S._Dhoni_-_The_Untold_Story_poster.jpg/220px-M.S._Dhoni_-_The_Untold_Story_poster.jpg
7 Khoon Maaf,tt1629376,"7 Khoon Maaf tells the story of an Anglo-Indian woman, Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes ( Priyanka Chopra ), who murders all her husbands. Susanna tries to find love, but each time of the six of seven times, her husband's flaws prove fatal. The story is narrated by Arun Kumar ( Vivaan Shah ), a forensic pathologist to his wife, Nandini ( Konkona Sen Sharma ). Arun has known Susanna, who was his rich benefactor, since his childhood, and had a secret crush on her. Susanna had lost her mother as an infant and her father some years later. Her parents had left her with a large inheritance and it was her father's last wish that she marry Major Edwin Rodriques.

Susanna's first husband, Edwin Rodriques ( Neil Nitin Mukesh ), is an army major who is jealous and possessive. Disabled after losing a leg, he suspects that the beautiful Susanna will be unfaithful and takes out his anger on her. Although Susanna tolerates Edwin's cruelty, she cannot forgive him for blinding her faithful, mute stableboy , Goonga Chacha (Shashi Malviya) with a whip. Edwin ends up becoming the animal's meal during a panther-hunting trip when Susanna pushes him over with the help of her faithful maid Maggie Aunty ( Usha Uthup ), butler Galib Khan ( Harish Khanna ), and the stableboy Goonga Chacha.

Susanna's second husband, Jamshed Singh Rathod ( John Abraham ), who renames himself Jimmy Stetson after their marriage, is a singer whose flaw is his gluttony. Jimmy becomes successful and misuses his fame – stealing songs and dalliances with other women and doing drugs. Susanna tries to wean him from his addiction, but when he continues in secret, he is disposed of with a heroin overdose by one of Susanna's faithful servants. Police investigators find footprints near his body, indicating that a person with six toes is the murderer but Susanna uses her charm to deflect suspicion.

Susanna's third husband, Mohammed Wasiullah Khan (also known as Musafir) ( Irrfan Khan ), is a soft-spoken, thoughtful poet by day and a sado-masochist by night, who tortures Susanna in bed. Susanna tries to cover her bruises, but her servants cannot bear to see her mistreated. One fateful night, Susanna seduces Khan and leads him out into the snow where he is ultimately buried alive in a snowy Kashmiri grave by Maggie and Galib Khan.

Her fourth husband, Nikolai Vronsky ( Alexander Dyachenko ), is a Russian spy leading a double life, who is enchanted by her. Even though she initially declines his desire to marry and says that she just wants to stay in love, she decides to test her luck once more and agrees to marry him. She sends Arun to a medical university in Russia to complete his studies. Alas, Arun finds Nikolai in Russia with his first wife and 2 daughters and sends secretly captured pictures of them to Susanna, which he regrets later as he holds himself responsible for Nikolai's imminent death. Susanna also discovers a document which confirms her suspicion that he is a spy, something he had denied earlier. When she confronts him, he tries to cover it up by saying that the woman he was with in Russia was his fellow agent. Susanna refuses to believe him. She then proceeds to throw the document in a well in which she houses her pet snakes. Nikolai unknowingly enters the well in the hope of recovering the document, and meets his inevitable death.

Her fifth husband, Keemat Lal ( Annu Kapoor ), is a police inspector who has shielded her from prosecution in exchange for sexual favors. Keemat Lal had protected her from being prosecuted for the murder of Nik in exchange for Nik's document and a sexual favour but he continued to come to Susanna for sexual intercourse. Susanna then marries him after his first wife gives him a divorce, but only with the intention of disposing of him for good. His dependence on Viagra then proves his undoing; one fateful night, Susanna mixes an overdose of the drug into Lal's drink, killing him. At this point, Arun returns from Russia as a doctor. When Susanna tries to seduce him, Arun leaves her, taking Goonga with him. It is the last straw for Susanna when she learns that Arun is now married to Nandini and has a son; and attempts to commit suicide with an overdose of sleeping pills.

Modhusudhon Tarafdar ( Naseeruddin Shah ) is a Bengali doctor who rescues Susanna from her suicide attempt and puts her on a mushroom-only diet. Although she does not want to marry him, he persuades her with a promise that she will be the sole heir of his property as he does not want his ex-wife and daughter to be able to claim it in the case of his death. Actually bankrupt, he tries to poison her in his greed for her inheritance. When her butler Galib dies of the poison mushrooms instead, Susanna shoots Tarafdar during a game of Russian roulette .

In despair, Susanna then sets the house ablaze in another suicide attempt as sleeping pills had already failed her once, she had forgotten the bullets beside Dr. Modhu’s corpse during their game of Russian Roulette and did not approve of a death by hanging. But as the fire reaches her bedroom, she changes her mind and flees the burning mansion. Her maid, Maggie Aunty dies in the attempt to rescue Susanna.

Some time later, Arun's wife Nandini finds out that Arun lied about his whereabouts and suspects that he is cheating on her with Susanna. In the forensics laboratory, Arun discovers that the body is Maggie Aunty's and not Susanna's but declares her dead to return her favour of educating him. He goes to Pondicherry looking for Susanna. They drink together and Susanna tells him that she is getting married once more and invites him to the wedding the next day. It is later revealed that Susanna decided to become a nun , in effect making Jesus Christ - representation of love and kindness – her seventh and final husband. She then confesses her seven sins to the church father ( Ruskin Bond ) and feels at peace.

Meanwhile, Nandini panics when Arun doesn't return in 2 days as he had promised and alerts the police. They set out on a search for him. Nandini finally reunites with Arun and he assures her that Susanna is dead and that the feelings he had for her are long gone and promises never to leave Nandini again.

The idea for 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book consisting of a collection of short stories to Vishal Bhardwaj . [ 7 ] He was intrigued by a 4-page story's title named ""Susanna's Seven Husbands"", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, ""I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came to know that she also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It reminded me of a very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives (1926)"". [ 8 ] Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. [ 9 ] Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film , decided to adapt the short story for the screen. [ 10 ] Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. [ 11 ] Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins .

Bhardwaj noted that he retained Bond's theme, but incorporated his own elements to make the film a dark comedy. He said, ""I had previously taken liberties with Shakespeare. Naturally, when you adapt a story, your vision also comes in it. But I have remained honest to its essence"". [ 8 ] He included Keemat Lal (who plays a police officer in all Bond's stories), although the character is not in the original story. Bhardwaj decided to include him in the film as an homage to Bond, explaining that he took liberties with characters' names and traits. [ 8 ] [ 12 ] Bond also had to devise Indian methods of killing the husbands, which he found challenging: ""The challenge was devising seven ingenious ways in which she could kill her husbands without being suspected. And she does it successfully, until towards the end"". [ 12 ]

Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's original choice for the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey (2009): [ 13 ] He said that Chopra ""is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director I had so much trust on her that I felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do"". [ 14 ] Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; [ 15 ] however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. [ 16 ] The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. [ 17 ] Pakistani actor Shamoon Abbasi and Ali Azmat offered to play two of the husband's role. However, They refused to do so due to the shooting of Pakistani film Waar (2013). [ 18 ] John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah were also cast in pivotal supporting roles. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play 2 of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. [ 21 ] Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance. [ 22 ]

During production, the film underwent 2 name changes. The project was initially titled Seven , which became Ek Bataa Saat , and finally 7 Khoon Maaf . In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup was used for her looks at different ages. [ 23 ] Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom , who did the makeup for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) to create seven looks for the character. [ 24 ] Chopra found the most challenging period was that of the 65-year-old woman. [ 25 ] The actress said, ""prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to be very careful of not doing things that would damage the make-up"". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother's photos to create her look. [ 26 ] She had to gain 5 kg weight to fit her aging character. [ 27 ]

Principal photography began in March 2010 with Chopra and Irrfan Khan in Kashmir. Locations included Shalimar Bagh and Dal Lake in Srinagar . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The cast and crew were provided with 2-tier security coverage by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Jammu & Kashmir Police, due to unrest in the valley.

The film's score and songs were composed by Vishal Bhardwaj , with lyrics by Gulzar . Its soundtrack contains seven songs and 2 reprise versions. The soundtrack was digitally released via Ovi (Nokia) internet service on 24 January 2011, and via CD on 25 January 2011. The song ""Darling"" is based on the Russian folk song "" Kalinka "", and contains several Russian words (one of Susanna's husbands was Russian). ""Kalinka"" is credited on the album cover. [ 40 ] ""Tere Liye"", sung by Suresh Wadkar , was not used in the film.

The film's preview and trailer were released on 24 December 2010 to a positive response from critics, who praised the whole presentation and Chopra's dialogues particularly: "" Duniya ki har biwi ne kabhie na kabhie toh yeh zarur socha hoga, ki main apne pati se hamesha hamesha ke liye chutkara kaise paun "" (""Every wife in the entire world must have once in her lifetime thought of how to get rid of her husband forever""). [ 41 ] Following the preview-trailer launches, Chopra promoted the film by appearing with seven men (dressed as bridegrooms) at the Radio Mirchi FM studio. [ 42 ] The succession of marriages and funerals was illustrated at a promotional event for the film, where Chopra appeared as a Catholic bride in a wedding gown holding a bouquet. A short time later she reappeared as a widow in mourning, for her husbands' funerals. [ 42 ] [ 43 ]

Emphasizing the film's theme, Chopra introduced a ""seven ways to lose your Valentine"" press kit for reporters at a Valentine's Day promotion. The kit contained a rope, a syringe, a knife, a bottle of poison, a sachet of potassium cyanide, an ice pick and a blister pack of Viagra, which was based on Susanna's way to kill her husbands in the film. [ 44 ] In February 2011, a book entitled Susanna's Seven Husbands was released by Penguin Books as a collector's edition including the novella, the short story and the film's screenplay. [ 45 ]

[ 5 ] Aniruddha Guha of the Daily News and Analysis rated the film a 4 (out of 5) and wrote, ""For a filmmaker who has long established his hold over the craft, 7 Khoon Maaf is the only way forward – it pushes the envelope and takes you on a cinematic journey you may not experience in a Hindi film for a long time to come"". She praised Chopra's performance: ""Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts it in a way that only she possibly can. For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime. And Bhardwaj ensures she sparkles like never before"". [ 52 ] The Indo-Asian News Service described the film as a ""winner"" by Vishal Bhardwaj, rating it 4 out of 5: ""Chalk up an absolute winner for the Vishal Bhardwaj-Priyanka Chopra team. They make a coherent vision out of an inconceivable marital crises."" [ 53 ] Zee News also rated the film 4 out of 5: ""Vishal Bhardwaj does it again. The maverick filmmaker has once again woven magic with his latest blockbuster Saat Khoon Maaf, which presents Priyanka Chopra in a never before character"". [ 54 ]

Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave the film a 3.5 (out of 5) rating, describing it as ""serious, sensitive and stirring"", ""a whole new cinematic experience"" and praising Chopra's performance: "" 7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly end up as a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema. She renders a subtle and restrained portrayal of a lonely and wronged woman who wanted love and only love from life"". [ 55 ] Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave 7 Khoon Maaf 3 out of 5 stars noting that the film was crafted around strong, effective scenes alone: a lot of them, cleanly cut and clinical, a whole lot immediately compelling, and recommended not to miss the partly captivating film [ 56 ] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 stars, saying that "" 7 Khoon Maaf is a dark film that has its share of positives and negatives. However, the film will meet with diverse reactions – some will fancy it, while some will abhor it. The film will appeal more to the critics/columnists and the festival circuit"". [ 57 ]

At the box office, the film opened to weak ticket sales across India (its release coincided with the 2011 Cricket World Cup ). [ 2 ] It grossed ₹ 14 crore (US$1.7 million) during its first week.

Its producers reported that the venture was commercially successful. Siddharth Roy Kapur (CEO of UTV Motion Pictures) said, "" 7 Khoon Maaf has worked well for us commercially due to a combination of tight production budgeting, optimized spending on prints and publicity and a pre-sales strategy that helped us to de-risk the film via sales of home video, music, satellite and theatrical rights even before the release"". [ 59 ]

7 Khoon Maaf received a number of nominations and won several awards, with Chopra winning most of her Best Actress nominations. It received 4 nominations at the 57th Filmfare Awards , and won 2 awards: Best Actress (Critics) (Chopra) and Best Female Playback Singer ( Usha Uthup and Rekha Bhardwaj for ""Darling"").

Queen (2014 film),tt3322420,"Rani Mehra ( Kangana Ranaut ) is a 24-year-old sheltered, meek, yet good-natured Punjabi woman from Delhi. Two days before her wedding, her fiancé Vijay Dhingra ( Rajkumar Rao ) tells her that he no longer wishes to marry her. He explains that his lifestyle has changed after living abroad, and Rani's conservative habits would be the wrong match for him. Stunned at the development, Rani shuts herself in her room for a day, recalling how she and Vijay met and fell in love. Wanting to control the situation, she asks her parents' permission to go alone on her pre-booked honeymoon to Paris and Amsterdam. After initially hesitating, her parents agree, thinking that a vacation might cheer her up. Rani's grandmother approves of her decision and assures her that sometimes things like this occur for the better.

In Paris, Rani meets Vijayalakshmi ( Lisa Haydon ), a free-spirited woman of French-Spanish-Indian descent who works at the hotel in which Rani stays. Overwhelmed by the new city and having gotten into trouble twice – once with the local police and once with a robber – Rani intends to return to India. However, Vijayalakshmi helps her out and gives her a tour around the city. The two have a series of adventures, during which Rani relives the memories of Vijay patronizing her and forbidding her from dancing and drinking – which she's free to do in Paris. During one particular incident, Rani tries on what she considers to be a revealing outfit and accidentally sends a selfie of her wearing the attire to Vijay instead of Vijayalakshmi. Rani quickly realizes her mistake, but unbeknownst to her, the selfie revives Vijay's interest in Rani, and he decides to seek her out.

Eventually, the time comes for Rani to bid an emotional farewell to Vijayalakshmi and leave for Amsterdam. However, when she arrives in Amsterdam, Rani finds that her hostel room is being shared with three men: Taka from Japan, Tim from France, and Oleksander from Russia. Despite being skeptical, she soon becomes good friends with them and spends time shopping, sightseeing, visiting a sex shop, going to a church, and meeting pole dancers in a club. Rani befriends a pole dancer named Roxette/Rukhsar ( Sabeeka Imam ), a Pakistani girl who is the sole breadwinner for her family back in Lahore and is also a friend of Vijayalakshmi.

Rani slowly begins to gain confidence by taking control of her decisions. Realizing her earning potential, she wins a cook-off by selling gol gappas. After the cook-off event, the Italian host and restaurant owner, Marcello, shares an intimate moment with her, and Rani experiences her first 'Indo-Italian' kiss with him. However, they choose to amicably part ways. She learns more about her friends' backgrounds and begins to understand how different life can be for people in other parts of the world.

One day, the four friends find Vijay waiting for Rani in front of the hostel. Vijay apologizes to Rani and asks her to reconsider their relationship. Their conversation escalates as he tries to grab hold of Rani, but her friends retaliate, and she asks him to leave. Rani decides to miss out on a concert with her friends to meet with Vijay and discuss their future. Vijay continues to judge Rani's new friends and behavior, like drinking champagne and her choice of living with roommates of the opposite gender, and tells her that she doesn't know foreigners. This causes her to leave abruptly, saying that she would rather speak to him after returning to Delhi. Rani then meets up with her friends one last time at the concert. After bidding a tearful farewell to them, she returns to India.

Back in Delhi, Rani visits Vijay at his home. Thinking she has decided to forgive him, he and his family start discussing wedding plans. Instead, Rani hands Vijay her engagement ring and says ""thank you,” suggesting that he gave her the opportunity to explore the world and develop herself by rejecting her. She then walks away with a confident smile on her face.

Producer-director Vikas Bahl made his directorial debut with Chillar Party (2011), co-directed with Nitesh Tiwari, which won three National Film Awards . Since he liked the story of Queen , he decided to direct the film himself. [ 17 ] It was eventually produced by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Phantom Films , which he co-owns with Anurag Kashyap and Vikram Motwane . [ 18 ]

The lead role of Rani was earlier offered to Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra , both of whom turned down the film. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] As he wrote the script, he based Rani on people he had observed while growing up in Delhi. ""I know life for girls is planned out for them by their families. They lose their own perspective on life and they are okay with that."" [ 21 ] In a scenario where as a girl crosses 20, her family gets busy to get her ""settled"", she never plans anything by herself, unless as in this case of Rani, marriage plans go awry. Thus the script was developed so that in the ""first half, Rani gets over the guy, and in the second, she gets over herself."" [ 22 ] Bahl wrote the script keeping Ranaut in mind, however it was Anurag Basu who connected him with her and helped cast her in the film. [ 23 ]

After her audition, actress Lisa Haydon, who played an Indo-French hotel staff member, Vijaylaksmi, practiced French for a month. Other actors Mish Boyko (Alexander) and Jeffery Ho (Taka) were cast after auditions in London, while Joseph Guitobh (Tim), who played Rani's third roommate, was spotted singing on a street and was asked whether he'd be interested in working in Hindi film, though he couldn't speak English. [ 21 ]

The film was shot in late 2012 over a period of 45 days, starting with Paris , followed by Amsterdam and Delhi . [ 21 ] Despite shooting abroad, Vikas Bahl did not have a huge budget to spend on the film. He took a crew of 25 people from India to shoot the film in about 145 locations in 40 days. Locations were booked a couple of hours, before the crew would rush to another location as they often shot 3–4 locations in a day. The crew would eat their meals at nearby restaurants, and at times actors including lead Kangana Ranaut would change clothes in nearby public toilets and restaurants. [ 17 ] [ 24 ] Since the film was not shot in a linear fashion, the colour of mehndi , applied to bride's hand was faded to match its natural fading. [ 21 ] During the filming upon Ranaut's suggestion some scenes were added, like the kiss scene with the Italian chef, and a small scene where Rani asks a stranger to click her picture in Amsterdam. [ 21 ] She even ended up writing a lot of her dialogue, and was given credit for the additional dialogue. In fact during filming, the director allowed all the actors to improvise their dialogue, to add realism to the film. [ 17 ] [ 22 ]

The remixed version of ""Hungama Ho Gaya"" was shot at Club NL, in Amsterdam, where a Hindi song was played for the first time. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]

However, when 90 percent of the film was already shot, cinematographer Bobby Singh died suddenly following an asthma attack on 25 December 2012, after just having completed a schedule in Delhi. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] After seeing rushes of the film, Anurag Kashyap volunteered to edit the film himself and since Bahl didn't have any editors at the time, he too agreed. [ 17 ]

The trailer of the film was released on 20 December 2013. [ 29 ]

The film's soundtrack is composed by Amit Trivedi , with lyrics by Anvita Dutt. [ 30 ] The album was released exclusively on iTunes on 23 January 2014, [ 31 ] followed by a release on all streaming platforms on 25 January 2014. [ 32 ] The music album was physically released on 5 February 2014 at the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival in Mumbai . [ 33 ] An additional track was released on 1 March 2014, it was the remixed version of hit cabaret number of the 1970s Hungama Ho Gaya sung by Asha Bhosle for the film, Anhonee (1973) was remixed by Amit Trivedi for the film, with additional vocals by Arijit Singh . The song was also used in end credits of the film. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 34 ]

Queen , as well as Ranaut's performance, received universal critical acclaim. [ 35 ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , Queen has an approval rating of 90% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. [ 36 ] On the Indian film review aggregator website The Review Monk, Queen received an average score of 8.1/10 based on 31 reviews and 100% critics being in the favor. [ 37 ]

Meena Iyer from Times of India gave the film a rating of 4.5/5 and wrote, ‘‘This film belongs to its director Vikas Bahl; Bollywood should blow bugles in his honour’’. Calling Ranaut a ‘‘class act’’ she further wrote, ‘‘Ranaut's performance is outstanding; Whether she's crestfallen or ecstatic, selling golgappas or naively buying sex-toys, hiding her infatuation for an Italian restaurateur or showing deep dejection about her wimpy beau Vijay, she's a class act’’. [ 38 ] Sarita Tanwar from DNA gave the film a rating of 4.5/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Queen is irresistible. Highly recommended. A must-see film. You will leave the theatre with your heart humming happily’’. Praising Ranaut's performance she further wrote, ‘‘Kangana displays a surprising capacity for both comedy and emotion. As Rani, she displays amazing vulnerability and depth that very few performers can pull off; She is a delight’’. [ 39 ] Saurabh Dwivedi from India Today gave the film a rating of 4.5/5 and called it a ‘‘must-watch’’. He praised Ranaut's performance by writing, ‘‘Kangana has a done fabulous job playing Rani; She has let her fans and audience know that she means business and is here to be taken seriously’’. [ 40 ] Devesh Sharma from Filmfare gave the film a rating of 4.5/5 and opined, ‘‘ Queen is definitely a step in the right direction for Indian Cinema’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he wrote, ‘‘It's Kangana's film from frame one. The way she flits from one aspect of her character to another without breaking strides shows her maturity as an actor’’. [ 41 ]

Subhash K Jha of The New Indian Express gave the film a rating of 4.5/5 and called Queen a ‘‘near flawless inspirational tale’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, ‘‘In Queen , Kangana is so in-sync with her character that you wonder if the story was written according to the emotions that the actress had stored away in her heart; Her performance holds the film together’’. [ 42 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film a rating of 4/5 and described ‘‘ Queen is spicy, balmy and uplifting. Like good gol gappas, it leaves a zesty aftertaste that lingers on until long after the ride has ended. It warms the heart and tickles the funny bone with equal force’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, ‘‘Kangana’s is the heart and soul of Queen and she does not strike a single false note; It is a performance that should define not only her career from here on, but also the fate of any young Bollywood actress seeking to push the boundaries of what is acceptable within the framework of the commercial Hindi movie industry’’. [ 43 ] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Queen reinvents the genre with its non-formulaic screenplay and skilled direction; A charming little film, this one's made with heart and feeling and it shows’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, ‘‘Kangana captures the nuances of her character spot-on; She's simply outstanding! The earnestness and sincerity she invests in her performance is for all to see; It won't be erroneous to state that she turns Rani into the most real woman you've encountered on the Hindi screen lately’’. [ 44 ] Anupama Chopra stated that, ‘‘ Queen is about the metamorphosis of Rani’’. She gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote, ‘‘Ultimately Queen is Kangana’s triumph. I left the theater thinking about Rani and how the rest of her life would pan out. It’s not often you do that with a Bollywood character’’. [ 45 ]

Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film a rating of 4/5 and described it as an ‘‘extraordinary journey of self-discovery’’. Calling Ranaut's performance ‘‘raw’’ and ‘‘nuanced’’ he further wrote, ‘‘it's Kangana Ranaut who makes you root for Rani from the word go; The best way to describe her fabulous performance is by confessing that I forgot I was watching Kangana. It's a raw, nuanced, delicately comical performance, and Bahl rightfully builds his film around his fearless, quirky heroine’’. [ 46 ] Raja Sen from Rediff gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Queen is a good entertainer, sure, but, more critically, it is a showcase for an actress poised to reign. This is one of those monumental moments when you feel the movies shift, and nothing remains the same; I've seen the future, baby, and it's Kangana’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, ‘‘Ranaut is gobstoppingly spectacular; she absolutely shines and the film stands back and lets her rule. It’s a bold but immaculately measured performance, internalised and powerful while simultaneously as overt as it needs to be to moisten every eye in the house’’. [ 47 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Queen is a significant Bollywood marker, a film that is intensely local and gloriously global, with a terrific lead performance by Kangana Ranaut, in a story that bubbles over with real feeling and meaning’’. Calling Ranaut the ‘‘Queen of Hearts’’ she further wrote, ‘‘Kangana Ranaut revels in her solidly-written role, and delivers a first rate, heart-felt performance’’. [ 48 ]

Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote, ‘‘ Queen explores a girl's identity as an independent entity. It's about a rooted Indian girl who goes on a holiday to find herself’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, ‘‘Kangana Ranaut as Rani, in a role of a lifetime, makes Queen an absolutely delightful journey. She wins us over first with innocence, small-town charm, vulnerability, spirit, strength, warmth and her gradual confidence’’. [ 49 ] Namrata Joshi of Outlook India gave the film a rating of 3.5/4 and wrote, ‘‘ Queen is a squarely mainstream film; Simplistic? Undemanding? Perhaps. But ultimately it is immensely warm and winsome, pressing just the right emotional buttons’’. [ 50 ] Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost called Queen a ‘‘fabulous film’’ and a ‘‘delight’’. Calling Ranaut's performance ‘‘endearing’’ and ‘‘electric’’ she wrote, ‘‘Ranaut as Rani is pitch perfect. She brings out the sweetness, the hurt, the belligerence and the head-screwed-tightly-on-her-shoulders sensibility that is the pride of the Indian middle class. The cherry on this acting cake is that this lady's got superb comic timing’’. [ 51 ]

Shafiq Ul Hasan from The Express Tribune gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Queen is a peek into the life of a woman who embarks upon a journey, her own honeymoon to be precise, in an attempt to find herself when her wedding is cancelled at the last minute’’. Praising Ranaut and Bahl he further wrote, ‘‘This was, by far, one of Kangana Ranaut’s truest and finest performances; Vikas Bahl directed the movie with superb class, I don’t think I would change a thing about it’’. [ 52 ] David Chute of Variety wrote, ‘‘ Queen seems an oddly modest film to have made such a big splash. It is charming and at times unexpectedly moving, especially in moments of cross-cultural bonding between Rani and the odd assorted group of expats who befriend her, as she wanders somewhat cluelessly around Paris and Amsterdam’’. [ 53 ] Olga Camacho of The National wrote, ‘‘There are surprisingly few clichés, romantic angles or moments of epiphany in the film – instead, we get some genuine laughs and an honest look at relationships’’. [ 54 ] Suparna Sharma of Deccan Chronicle gave the film a rating of 3/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Queen is a well-meaning, well-mannered film that's funny and packs in small, elevating, but palatable messages. It challenges nothing; It just shows an Indian girl slowly, gently renegotiating life while remaining true to who she is’’. Praising Ranaut's performance she further wrote, ‘‘Kangana Ranaut has always been a powerful performer. She's an actress with lots of talent who has taken on roles that are different, challenging and out of the league of most Bollywood actresses fighting the number game. And here too she has made a bold choice and a difficult one as well. She stays true to the character she is playing, as it has been etched out, never once over-reaching and going for histrionics. She doesn’t try to grab you. She just tugs at you, with her subtle, nuanced performance; She is in complete control and is very good’’. [ 55 ]

Anupama Chopra of Film Companion crowned Queen as the best film of the year 2014. [ 8 ] Mihir Fadnavis of Firstpost cited Queen as one of the best Bollywood films of 2014.

According to Hindustan Times , Queen is considered to be Ranaut's calling-card film. Not only did it cement Ranaut as one of the most sought-after actors in the Hindi film industry, it also changed the Bollywood landscape and inspired a streak of films like NH10 (2015), Piku (2015), Neerja (2016), Pink (2016) and Lipstick Under My Burkha (2017). They further stated, ‘‘ Queen's success empowered not only female actors, but also producers, who could no longer cite the lack of stars as being detrimental to their films’ chances at the box office’’.

Namrata Joshi called Queen a ‘‘game-changer’’. She wrote, ‘‘It was Queen (2014) that was the real game changer; The low-budget film hit a chord, quickly climbing to the top of the charts and since then, other films have featured male superstars fighting for women’s causes, such as Aamir Khan in Dangal (2016), or showing their feminist side, such as Akshay Kumar making rotis (flatbread) for his on-screen wife in Jolly LLB 2 (2017)’’. [ 75 ] About Ranaut's performance in Queen , Saibal Chatterjee opined, ‘‘It is a performance that should define not only her career, but also the fate of any young Bollywood actress seeking to push the boundaries of what is acceptable within the framework of the commercial Hindi movie industry’’.

[ 76 ] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare called Queen a ‘‘step in right direction for Indian Cinema’’.

Runjhun Noopur from Arré called Queen a classic film and wrote, ‘‘ Queen is a rare legit classic, as relevant today as it was in 2014’’. She described Queen as a groundbreaking and an influential feminist film . Writing about Queen's legacy she opined, ‘‘ Queen is a piece of art with a life of its own, a story that makes you feel connected to the world in ways few things can; Beyond the feminism , it is a story of human triumph that gives you hope and makes you want to fight for your happiness; It makes you want to believe in people, in friends, in strangers who become your fleeting accomplices in the journey of life and that is the true legacy of Queen ’’. [ 77 ] Shrishti Negi from CNN-IBN cited Queen as one of the best movies of 2010s decade and the film which represents or defined the year 2014 in Hindi Cinema. She further wrote, ‘‘In Bollywood, where we are used to watching romance between a couple (man and woman), Queen shows us some other kind of love, i.e. self-love, which is not only liberating but completely fulfilling’’. [ 78 ] Anupama Chopra called Queen a ‘‘Kangana’s triumph’’. [ 45 ] Arushi Kapoor from Vagabomb called Queen the most feminist film of recent years and stated, ‘‘ Queen undoubtedly made a strong statement with the central plot of a girl moving on after being left at the altar and finding herself; but even beyond the essence of the film was a multi-layered message of beautifully portrayed feminist ideals; Queen was, arguably, the most feminist film in Bollywood post the 2000’s and definitely a lesson in Feminism 101’’. [ 79 ] Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express named Queen as one of India’s seventy-five most iconic films that celebrate the journey of the country. [ 15 ] She also featured Queen in her book called ‘‘50 Films That Changed Bollywood’’. [ 80 ] In 2017, cultural professor Rachel Dwyer named Queen as one of the 70 iconic Movies of Independent India. [ 81 ]

Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost stated that, ‘‘ Queen is the first time Ranaut got a script that really allows her to confirm she's more than a pretty face. There's no high fashion or flattering make-up to flaunt Ranaut's physical beauty in Queen , but this is a role that allows Ranaut to showcase not just her acting talents, but also her wit because Ranaut is credited with contributing additional dialogues to the film’’. [ 51 ] Aamy Kuldip of Brown Girl Magazine said Queen should be every brown girl’s favorite movie and opined, ‘‘ Queen won our hearts and it started the era of brown girls with new-found confidence’’. He called Ranaut's character in Queen , Rani, the ‘‘epitome’’ of the average brown girl trying to settle in the misogynistic and hypocritical world of ours; coming to the realization that accepting yourself is the first step in having the world accept you.

Krishna Aur Kans,tt2321492,"The demon king Kans reigns as a tyrant over the Kingdom of Mathura and aims to conquer the world. To put an end to his bloodthirsty reign, the gods decide to incarnate on Earth Vishnu , who is born in the form of Krishna , son of Devaki , the sister of Kans. The baby, nephew of the tyrant, is born in the village of Vrindavan , where he is adopted by the village chief, Nanda , who raises him in the same way as his own slightly older son, Balram . Krishna grows up in a good mood and becomes a mischievous little boy, who makes his mother see all the colors and is always ready to play a trick on the Gopi , the cowherds who watch over him. But he distinguished himself very early on by his miraculous exploits, and the music of his flute charmed men and beasts. Krishna especially befriends a little girl of his age, Radha (his future wife in Hindu mythology ), but also befriends several boys, including Madhumangal. He can also count on the help of the monkey Dabiloba and the lamb Hamsi. Krishna must soon come to the aid of the people of the kingdom and face the supernatural perils sent to him by Kans, mainly the demons Trinavarta , Bakasur and Pootna . But, seeing Krishna easily defeating each of his envoys, Kans ends up challenging him to a duel in the coliseum of his capital, resulting in the latter killing him and releasing his parents from the dungeon. Several songs punctuate the film.

Ki & Ka,tt4744086,"Kia is a motivated, driven woman who aims to become successful in the business world, and also wishes that more women aspire to prosper in their careers. Kabir is the laid back son of a successful building constructor, who does not wish to take over his father's company or inherit his wealth.

The pair meet, quickly become friends, and gradually fall in love. They realise that Kabir's preference to stay at home fits perfectly with Kia's wish to climb up the corporate ladder. The couple marry and Kabir becomes a ghar jamai after the disapproval of his father. Kia and Kabir establish a relationship where Kabir handles the daily household affairs, while Kia is the main breadwinner. Kia rises quickly in her career, and she is soon interviewed about her success. During the interview, Kia mentions her 'unusual' marriage and her husband's role in their household. The interviewer is impressed by this, and requests a meeting with Kabir. While being questioned, Kabir explains that it does not matter if ki (feminine Hindi pronoun) takes up the role of ka (masculine Hindi pronoun), and ka takes up the role of ki.

The interview is very well received and Kabir is asked to hold many more seminars and speeches on gender equality and modern marriages. Kabir's busy schedule causes a strain in the marriage, causing Kia to become jealous of her husband's newfound fame. She accuses Kabir of using their relationship to get recognition and publicity, and asks him to stop making public appearances.

While Kia is in the US, attending a work event, Kabir is invited to his college reunion, and is pressured by a friend into giving another interview, which is broadcast on TV. Film actress Jaya Bachchan sees this interview, and asks her husband, superstar Amitabh Bachchan to call Kabir and organise a meeting with him. Jaya is highly impressed with the story of the couple's unconventional marriage. Kia receives news of this meeting while in the US, causing more arguments between her and Kabir. Meanwhile, Kia's mother is taken to the hospital after collapsing, causing her to rush back to India.

Once back home, Kia accuses Kabir of using her, saying that he used their relationship for his own profit. Kia further condemns Kabir for gaining fame without working, as she feels that her hard work and successful career are going unnoticed. Dejected, Kabir does not defend himself and starts packing to leave. Kia comes across a gift that Jaya gave to Kabir for his wife, and also a letter written by the actress, in which she congratulates the pair and says that to be a man who maintains a household rather than work is a brave choice, but to be the wife of such a man is an even harder choice. Kia's mother also confronts her about her jealousy, and says that it is the reason for the couple's many fights. Kia realizes that she has been unfairly tough on Kabir and apologizes to him for her behavior and temperament. The couple reconciles and finds a happy compromise. Kabir's father, who has come to appreciate Kia's business acumen and drive, decides to make her the CEO of his company.

Balki finished the script in July 2015. The film derives its title from linguistic gender divisions of the Hindi language found in the words ""ladki"" and ""ladka"" meaning ""girl"" and ""boy"". He said, """"In Hindi not just human beings but also nonliving objects have gender. Everybody and everything is categorised. But this film, like the couple's marriage, underlines the fact that Ki and Ka as genders don't matter."" [ 3 ]

The early estimate for the film's box office revenue on the first day was around ₹ 67.5 million (US$800,000) net. [ 4 ] The film managed to pick up record collections of ₹ 72.5 million (US$860,000) approximately on the first day. [ 5 ] It earned ₹ 82.5 million (US$980,000) on second day. [ 6 ] The film earned ₹ 92.5 million (US$1.1 million) on third day. The film had a decent weekend though the trend was not great for a content urban film. The weekend business of Ki & Ka was ₹ 248 million (US$2.9 million). [ 7 ] Ki & Ka had the normal Monday drop of around 50%. A ₹ 35.0 million (US$410,000) nett plus Monday is reasonable for the film. [ 8 ] Ki & Ka held very well on 5th day with a very limited drop of around 6–7%, film earned ₹ 32.5 million (US$380,000) on 5th day. [ 9 ] The film had a decent first week of ₹ 370 million (US$4.4 million) nett approx. in India. [ 10 ] The film earned ₹ 390 million (US$4.6 million) in eight days. [ 11 ]

The soundtrack album features songs composed by Meet Bros for the T-Series label [ 12 ] besides having an original song composed by Balki's regular collaborator Ilaiyaraaja , who has also composed the background score of the movie.

Lyrics have been penned by Kumaar , Amitabh Bhattacharya and Sayeed Quadri . [ 13 ] The soundtrack was released on 25 February 2016. [ 14 ]

Critic Rajeev Masand rated the film 2/5, writing, "" Ki & Ka arrives with a curious premise, but Balki fails to flesh it out into an engaging film. I was especially pleased to see Kareena Kapoor sink her teeth into a solid role after what seems like an eternity. Arjun Kapoor deserves credit for taking a role that few male stars would, but both actors are let down by the inert writing."" [ 15 ] Anupama Chopra also rated it 2/5. She reasoned that ""One of the enduring problems with Balki's films persists – his crackling concept runs out of steam. It's almost as if he spends so much of his creative energy coming up with the high-wire idea that he has none left to flesh out the narrative around it."" [ 16 ] Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 stars out of 5, and stated, ""On the whole, Ki & Ka is a cleverly crafted feel-good film that packs all the emotions. Though it has strong performances by both Arjun and Kareena, the film is bound to draw extreme reactions from the orthodox audiences who may find the premise difficult to digest. It is an urban progressive film and should appeal more to women and young married couples."" [ 17 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2 stars and termed it as ""rocky"" while commenting that ""The film is fun when it is setting up the roles. But the execution, as it goes along, gets rocky. Much of it stays episodic, and starts reinforcing the very stereotypes it set out to negate. The problem is the film's unwillingness to go the mile. She also noted that it could have been more ""sharper"" and ""deeper"". [ 18 ] Rohit Vats from Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 2.5 and noted that film has a lot of drama and summarized, ""There is no denying that Ki & Ka has a noble concept, but hasn't the director very conveniently confined himself to a comfort zone where he only needs to break some generalised stereotypes such as ‘women can't be ambitious’ or ‘men can't cook at home’ or ‘a woman's career is finished after pregnancy’? Ki & Ka isn't a strong voice against gender stereotyping, but it's one of its kind in mainstream Hindi film industry, and that makes it notice-worthy."" [ 19 ] Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the film 4 stars and stated, ""Kareena is terrific, Arjun, endearing. But Balki's writing is inconsistent. A few scenes leave you misty-eyed, but for the most part, the stock situations are banal. Yet, Ki and Ka is worth a ticket because it tells shows how there is nothing wrong with the man wearing the apron and the women wearing her ambition."" [ 20 ]

Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave it 2.5 stars while noting, "" Ki & Ka is obviously taken in by its liberal notions but fails to realise that it's not so uncommon in today's urban context where lots of working men and women share both their professional and personal duties."" [ 21 ] Sarita A Tanwar of Daily News & Analysis gave it 2.5 stars and described the film as ""stretched"" and ""cheesy"" but also called it ""a daring film"" while interpreting it as ""The best thing about the film is that it questions gender roles that we impose on ourselves and each other. But, the film loses momentum mid-way. The idea is stretched too thin and the climax is cheesy. It's enjoyable when it's not trite. You might take to it if you are the sort that enjoys clichés."" [ 22 ] Pallavi Patra from Zee News gave it 2 stars and mentioned it as ""trite enterprise"" while summarizing the film as "" Ki & Ka is a seemingly funny enterprise with a feminist theme gone awry. It's not the theme that is at trouble here but a laid-back script coupled with an ostensibly manufactured chemistry between its promising leads. Watch it or not, Ki & Ka prefix will enjoy its dominance over the youth – but cinematic wise – not a good picture here"". [ 23 ] Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV gave the film 2 stars and called it ""intermittently watchable"". He noted, ""A concept film that has a lot to say – Ki And Ka actually succeeds in getting a few of its points in edgewise – but the writing is below-par. As a consequence, Ki And Ka is like a string of patched-together monosyllables that never attain sustained coherence. Too much talk and very little plot progression put the skids under the film. Ki And Ka goes belly up pretty quickly never to recover fully."" [ 24 ] Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today gave a low rating of 1.5 and summarized it as ""good germs of film spoilt by bad execution"" and mentioned, ""he film tries so hard to be what it is not that it loses way badly. The writing is not a field which Ki And Ka excels in. The film, for most part, feels like a rehearsal of sorts. Both Arjun and Kareena look like they are mouthing sharp, one-tone dialogues to impress the conductor of this out-of-tune opera that is Ki And Ka . The ping-pong dialogue-delivery between Arjun and Kareena is a major dampener."" [ 25 ] Anna M.M. Vetticad from Firstpost also criticised the film as ""fun concept spoilt by patchy plot"" while stating ""Large swathes of Ki & Ka are fun, considerable sections of it are unexpectedly broad-minded, path-breaking for Bollywood and insightful. The problem is that we can section it off in this fashion. Ultimately, what fails the film is its mixed messaging and choppy texture.""

The collected information is scrutinised and debated over by the panel in an attempt to unravel the truth.

The film was announced in January 2018 as India's first ""crowd-sourced"" thriller. Principal photography began in January 2018. [ 7 ] In February 2018 he invited from the public any information, book, link or memory related to Lal Bahadur Shastri ’s mysterious death in Tashkent to help him solve the 'decades old enigma' surrounding the death of former Prime Minister of India.

[ 19 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Agnihotri touted the film to be the first instalment of his trilogy of ""untold stories of independent India"", which is followed by The Kashmir Files (2022) and an upcoming film The Delhi Files . [ 20 ]

The Tashkent Files received overwhelmingly negative reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds a 0% approval rating based on 8 reviews. [ 21 ]

Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave two and half stars out of five; it was a 'melodramatic' episode with loud and over the top acting coupled with bombastic dialogues. Sharma found the film to be biased against a certain political party and wondered about its release during the national elections, which were running concurrently. [ 22 ]

Writing for Scroll.in , Nandini Ramnath found it to be a politically motivated work that did not have any rigor and failed to be an effective conspiracy thriller. [ 23 ] Saibal Chatterjee , writing for NDTV rated the film with half star out of five — the research that went into the production was equivalent of a Google search film-making and overall, it was ""junk."" [ 24 ] Jyoti Sharma Bawa, reviewing for the Hindustan Times rated it one out of five stars and reiterated Chatterjee. [ 25 ] Mid-Day gave one and a half stars out of five — all the research that went into the work was derived from internet, esp. social media. [ 26 ]

A review over India Today rated it one out of five stars and noted it to be a politically motivated film that did not have any logic and might be easily dispensed with. [ 27 ] A review over The Hindu noted it to be an ideological slideshow that exploited Shastri's death to attack left, secular and socialist ideologies and institutions and though based on an engaging topic, was a 'hotch-potch of hearsay, juvenile arguments' that ultimately lend to utter confusion rather than any conviction. [ 28 ] Another review over News18 India rated it one out of five stars and noted it to be a politically motivated film with unconvincing arguments, that made for a dull watch. [ 29 ]

A review in The First Post asserted it to be a politically motivated film and rated it two out of five stars. Noting Agnihotri to neither have the finesse nor the potency to sketch a conspiracy thriller, the reviewer deemed it to be a cheap trick, that was high on hysteria but lacked logic amidst a focus-less frenzied storytelling that did not venture beyond the realms of Google. [ 30 ] A review in The Indian Express deemed it to be the ideal politically-motivated fiction for the 'post-truth, fake news era' — a series of eye-roll moments with unintentionally hilarious dialogues. [ 31 ] ThePrint found it to be a shoddy jab at film-making that harnessed a mish-mash of unformed characters and incomplete plots devoid of logic. [ 32 ] Bollywood Hungama gave one and a half stars out of five. [ 33 ]

Anusha Iyengar, reviewing for Times Now , gave two out of five stars, praising the story but taking issues with over-the-top dramatization that reeked of amateurish storytelling. [ 33 ] Manavi Kapur, reviewing the film at Business Standard , found it unworthy for even a daytime opera slot. [ 34 ] Shilajit Mitra, reviewing for The New Indian Express remarked it to be an exhausting head-spin of a political propaganda, that became weirder with time. [ 35 ] Stutee Ghosh of The Quint found it to be a prejudiced, amateurish and cringe-worthy film with an uninspiring storytelling that banked on crowd-sourced research; she rated one star out of five.

Gabbar Is Back,tt2424988,"The police get information that 10 tehsildars across Maharashtra have been mysteriously kidnapped. However, no sooner are they mysteriously returned – except the most corrupt officer, who is hanged . The police get a CD from mystery man 'Gabbar', who says his mission is to target corrupt officers. Police driver Sadhuram is convinced he can crack the mystery of who is Gabbar.

National College professor Aditya thrashes some goons who try to vandalize college property. On his way home one night, he encounters a young lawyer, Shruti, who is in a hurry to take a pregnant woman to the hospital. Some days later, she bumps into Aditya again during a fight, and they begin dating. Sadhuram in the meantime finds out there's one honest officer in each department across the state, and is convinced that each of these honest officers has a link to Gabbar.

One fateful day, Aditya and Shruti are checking out of a roadside café when Shruti is hurt in a minor accident, and Aditya takes her to the Patil Hospital where a female doctor insists on taking a number of expensive tests. Aditya happens to overhear a doctor try to suggest the rather expensive Caesarean section delivery and is soon convinced of the hospital staff's dirty tricks when he notices a father-daughter duo being informed of the mother's death only after an expensive bill was paid. He deliberately checks in a poor woman's dead husband as a patient; unaware of his trap, the hospital tries to swindle money out of Aditya by pretending to treat the already dead man, making him pay heavily for tests and medicines. However, Aditya shows them the death certificate as a proof of their knowingly admitting a dead man. The young owner of the hospital, Vikas Patil, is furious when Aditya releases the video of the hospital's corruption to the media despite having struck a deal with him. Vikas is murdered by the enraged public, and his father Digvijay Patil sees Aditya in the hospital CCTV footage, only to realize this is the same man he had supposedly killed five years ago.

A flashback soon reveals that Aditya's pregnant wife Sunaina died when the buildings in their colony collapsed and killed hundreds of other people too. Aditya collected proof of the faulty buildings against builder Digvijay, who bribed everyone and tried to bribe Aditya too by offering Rs. 10 million to spare the matter, but Aditya spurned the offer by fighting everyone in the room and nearly killing Digvijay. Aditya spared him when the latter asked for forgiveness, but Digvijay brutally retaliated by hitting him with an axe and left him for dead. However, a bus full of medical students found the unconscious Aditya on a highway and saved his life. He then decided to use the power of idealistic, young, honest youths and trained students at National College to join his cause. Meanwhile, Sadhuram finds that all the honest officers attended National College for graduation. Shruti discovers that Aditya is the real Gabbar and is shocked but when he tells her the truth, she supports his cause.

CBI officer Kuldeep Pahwa takes charge of the case and is mystified by the facts. He listens to Sadhuram's findings, and they arrest the National College students listed by Sadhuram, but upon being beaten, the students do not divulge anything about Gabbar, which enrages him further. Shruti tells Kuldeep that because the law doesn't work, a vigilante like Gabbar has become a hero for ordinary citizens. Sadhuram changes his view of Gabbar. Digvijay kills an honest officer to terrorize others into passing his faulty building plans. Gabbar targets Digvijay for his act. Digvijay throws a birthday party for himself, and as he cuts the cake, he spots Aditya. Aditya and his gang kidnap him. As police search the city for Digvijay in vain, Aditya kills Digvijay in a fight that ensues between the two, following which he surrenders himself to the police and is eventually given a death penalty , sparking huge public protests and enraged students block his jail van. Kuldeep requests him to speak to the students and he does, telling them to channel their anger against corruption and be the change society needs. Finally, while being prepared to be hanged, Aditya remarks that he will die but the movement will live on.

Gabbar Is Back,tt2424988,"The police get information that 10 tehsildars across Maharashtra have been mysteriously kidnapped. However, no sooner are they mysteriously returned – except the most corrupt officer, who is hanged . The police get a CD from mystery man 'Gabbar', who says his mission is to target corrupt officers. Police driver Sadhuram is convinced he can crack the mystery of who is Gabbar.

National College professor Aditya thrashes some goons who try to vandalize college property. On his way home one night, he encounters a young lawyer, Shruti, who is in a hurry to take a pregnant woman to the hospital. Some days later, she bumps into Aditya again during a fight, and they begin dating. Sadhuram in the meantime finds out there's one honest officer in each department across the state, and is convinced that each of these honest officers has a link to Gabbar.

One fateful day, Aditya and Shruti are checking out of a roadside café when Shruti is hurt in a minor accident, and Aditya takes her to the Patil Hospital where a female doctor insists on taking a number of expensive tests. Aditya happens to overhear a doctor try to suggest the rather expensive Caesarean section delivery and is soon convinced of the hospital staff's dirty tricks when he notices a father-daughter duo being informed of the mother's death only after an expensive bill was paid. He deliberately checks in a poor woman's dead husband as a patient; unaware of his trap, the hospital tries to swindle money out of Aditya by pretending to treat the already dead man, making him pay heavily for tests and medicines. However, Aditya shows them the death certificate as a proof of their knowingly admitting a dead man. The young owner of the hospital, Vikas Patil, is furious when Aditya releases the video of the hospital's corruption to the media despite having struck a deal with him. Vikas is murdered by the enraged public, and his father Digvijay Patil sees Aditya in the hospital CCTV footage, only to realize this is the same man he had supposedly killed five years ago.

A flashback soon reveals that Aditya's pregnant wife Sunaina died when the buildings in their colony collapsed and killed hundreds of other people too. Aditya collected proof of the faulty buildings against builder Digvijay, who bribed everyone and tried to bribe Aditya too by offering Rs. 10 million to spare the matter, but Aditya spurned the offer by fighting everyone in the room and nearly killing Digvijay. Aditya spared him when the latter asked for forgiveness, but Digvijay brutally retaliated by hitting him with an axe and left him for dead. However, a bus full of medical students found the unconscious Aditya on a highway and saved his life. He then decided to use the power of idealistic, young, honest youths and trained students at National College to join his cause. Meanwhile, Sadhuram finds that all the honest officers attended National College for graduation. Shruti discovers that Aditya is the real Gabbar and is shocked but when he tells her the truth, she supports his cause.

CBI officer Kuldeep Pahwa takes charge of the case and is mystified by the facts. He listens to Sadhuram's findings, and they arrest the National College students listed by Sadhuram, but upon being beaten, the students do not divulge anything about Gabbar, which enrages him further. Shruti tells Kuldeep that because the law doesn't work, a vigilante like Gabbar has become a hero for ordinary citizens. Sadhuram changes his view of Gabbar. Digvijay kills an honest officer to terrorize others into passing his faulty building plans. Gabbar targets Digvijay for his act. Digvijay throws a birthday party for himself, and as he cuts the cake, he spots Aditya. Aditya and his gang kidnap him. As police search the city for Digvijay in vain, Aditya kills Digvijay in a fight that ensues between the two, following which he surrenders himself to the police and is eventually given a death penalty , sparking huge public protests and enraged students block his jail van. Kuldeep requests him to speak to the students and he does, telling them to channel their anger against corruption and be the change society needs. Finally, while being prepared to be hanged, Aditya remarks that he will die but the movement will live on.

Sharafat Gayi Tel Lene,tt4373886,"Prithvi Khuranna ( Zayed Khan ), a middle class working professional, has to work hard in order to survive in the city and also to pay the landlord's rent plus other 'unavoidable' expenses until one day he discovers that his account has been credited with 100 crores (i.e. 1 billion rupees)! Finding this hard to believe, he calls up the bank's customer care where he hears that his account has been upgraded to the 'platinum class'. Before this news can sink in his system, he gets a call from an unknown number with the caller claiming to be the notorious gangster Dawood. Dawood then ""orders"" Prithvi to get into a mutually profitable deal with him where he has to deliver large sums of money at different times and places to Dawood's henchwoman lady Rasheeda ( Talia Bentson ).

Prithvi immediately calls up his roommate Sam ( Rannvijay Singh ), who thrives on women and money (easy money, to be precise), to share the news with him. Just as the duo is busy planning what to do with the whopping amount of money, the bank's Vice President D.K. Thawani ( Anupam Kher ) shows up on his doorstep to offer his personalised service to his 'esteemed customer'. All of this startles Prithvi to no end. Seeing Prithvi behave 'abnormally', his ever-so-concerned girlfriend Megha ( Tina Desai ), who is a TV journalist by profession, immediately calls her top-cop uncle G.S. Chaddha ( Yuri Suri ) who then starts tracking Prithvi's phone calls. Prithvi's confidence levels take a downturn when he discovers that D.K. Thawani is actually Dawood's man in the disguise of a bank manager. Just when things are getting settled down, life again takes an upturn for Prithvi when he hears the breaking news about Dawood's sudden death on the TV channels. Needless to say, Dawood's death means that Prithvi becomes the sole owner of the remaining 600 million in his bank account.

Prithvi tells the whole story to Megha and they both decide to go to police the next day but Sam convinces them to enjoy and party for once before returning all the money. While at the club Prithvi gets a call from Dawood and Megha gets abducted only to be found unconscious in Prithvi's car. Shocked by this incident Sam confesses to them that the calls from Dawood were fake and were made by Rasheeda (whose real name is Rachel). Sam has actually won an online lottery from a link send by Rachel but by using Prithvi's Debit card. On winning the prize money of 1 billion the whole amount got transferred in Prithvi's bank account. Hence Sam and Rachel faked the Dawood calls to get all the money back from him.

By now Sam has found out that D.K. Thawani and Rachel are planning to kill him as well after they get all the money. They also realise that the lottery site is a fake and it was all a money laundering scheme which was devised by business tycoon Ram Sharan Oberoi to transfer black money to India. Prithvi and Sam realise they are in trouble as they will be soon interrogated by RBI and Police for transferring black money to India.

Prithvi then makes a plan and together they abduct Rachel. Then Prithvi makes a fake call (pretending to be Oberoi) to Thawani and steals all the money from his house. Later Prithvi goes to Thawani's office and records his confession on a hidden camera which results in Thawani and Oberoi being arrested. The film ends with Prithvi getting 20 million reward money from the government but just as he thinks it is all over, he receives a call from the real Dawood...

Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2,tt1954470,"At the end of Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 1 , Sultan Qureshi had Sardar Khan murdered by three associates.  Danish, Faizal, and Asgar track down two of his killers and murder them, but Danish is arrested in the process. Sultan and Fazlu gun him down at his court appearance. At Danish's funeral, Nagma doubts Faizal's ability to exact revenge, but Faizal promises her that he will.

Realizing that he has been duped by Fazlu, Faizal meets him on the pretext of congratulating him for winning a local election but instead beheads him. By doing so, Faizal makes his mark and eventually comes to control the illegal iron trade in the area. Faizal then makes a truce with Ramadhir Singh - he will not attempt to avenge his family as long as Ramadhir provides him political support. As Faizal's business grows, he marries his sweetheart, Mohsina Hamid. Faizal eventually tracks down his father's third killer and murders him, completing his revenge.

In 2003, a small-time goon named Shamshad Alam becomes allied with Faizal. Shamshad offers to increase Faizal's profits with his knowledge of the scrap iron business, but keeps increasingly significant portions of the profit for himself. When this is revealed to Faizal, Shamshad goes to the police and provides phone calls as evidence of Faizal's involvement in the illegal iron trade. Meanwhile, local shopkeepers lose their patience with Faizal's younger brother Perpendicular's antics and hire Sultan to kill him. Ramadhir is losing faith in his son J.P.'s ability to run his empire, and J.P. often finds himself in line of fire for his inability. This results in the waning of JP's prominence and influence.

In December 2003, Sultan's men track down Perpendicular and kill him. When Faizal goes to retrieve the body, he is arrested by the police. With Faizal in jail, Definite decides to kill Shamshad before Shamshad tries to fill Faizal's vacant position, but his pistol jams at the last moment, and he is forced to run. Definite eludes Shamshad but jumps onto a train car full of Army soldiers. He is arrested and jailed; there he meets Faizal.

Ramadhir advises Shamshad to bail Definite out of jail and then instigate him against his own brother for his empire. Ramadhir feels like he can influence Definite due to his connection with Definite's mother Durga. Faizal is aware of Shamshad's plan and cautions Definite before he leaves the jail. Definite carries out a grenade attack at Shamshad's office, causing Shamshad to lose a leg. Sultan narrowly escapes injury and chases Definite back to Faizal's house. There he finds his own sister Shama. Angry at her for marrying Danish, Sultan shoots her and leaves her for dead. She survives but falls into a coma.

In January 2004, when Faizal is released from jail, J.P. cautions Sultan and advises him to kill Faizal in a preemptive strike. Sultan launches a massive fire strike (depicted at the beginning of Part I) on Faizal's house, but Faizal and his entire family have a lucky escape. As Sultan's gang is leaving, they find a police checkpoint waiting for them and realise that they were double crossed by J.P., but Sultan escapes in the ensuing firefight. A few days later, Sultan's men kill Nagma and Asgar in a market; Definite and his men track Sultan to Bhagalpur and kill him in revenge. Upon realising that Definite has avenged Danish, Shama, Nagma, and Asgar, Faizal tells him to surrender to cement his reputation. With Definite in jail, Ramadhir then aims to create a rift between Definite and Faizal.

In 2005, Iqlakh, an educated English speaker, enters Faizal's gang. Iqlakh actually wants to exact revenge and is Ramadhir's mole.  Faizal is initially impressed with Iqlakh's skills and is later made aware of Iqlakh's background but decides to ignore it. Iqlakh has an astute knowledge of business and bags scrap auctions by force. This brings in a lot of profit for Faizal and causes him to neglect Definite. Iqlakh advises Faizal to enter politics in order to provide political protection to all his activities. Faizal decides to contest from Ramadhir's constituency to exact his own revenge.

Ramadhir, feeling threatened, has Definite released from jail and sends J.P. to negotiate a deal. J.P., however, is tired of his father's insults and wants to use Faizal to kill him. Ramadhir's plan is that Iqlakh will kill Faizal on election day, and if he is unable, Definite will take the shot. On election day, Definite's gang disrupts the elections to prevent Faizal from winning. Iqlakh leads Faizal to an isolated place and tries to kill them, but Definite arrives, double-crosses Iqlakh, and kills him, explaining to Faizal that Ramadhir changed the plan.

Despite a now-pregnant Mohsina's pleas, Faizal decides to attack Ramadhir. Faizal, Definite, and his men attack a meeting between Ramadhir and Shamshed and murder both. In the ensuing firefight with the police, Faizal and Definite are the only survivors and are arrested. En route to prison, the police halt at a roadside restaurant for refreshments, leaving Faizal alone in the police van. Faizal is then shot dead by Definite, released by the police. It is revealed that J.P. was the architect of the massacre, and Definite is seen free, walking towards his mother.

Four years later, in 2009, Mohsina and Nasir have moved to Mumbai with Faizal's young son, Feroz. Definite now rules Wasseypur. Nasir describes that Wasseypur was not affected by Ramadhir's and Faizal's deaths and concludes that it is still a battlefield like before.

The soundtrack album of the two-part compilation of Gangs of Wasseypur has a whopping 27 songs, which are composed by Sneha Khanwalkar and Piyush Mishra , with lyrics by Mishra and Varun Grover . However, the album was split up according to the film's release. [ 12 ] The film score is composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar . Part-2 has 13 songs which were released on 11 July 2012. [ 13 ]

In several areas of the two cities, political posters had been plastered, in which the two opposing contestants from the movie Ramadhir Singh and Faizal Khan, vied for votes. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]

The main cast of Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2 shot with the cast of Afsar Bitiya . Actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Faisal Khan) and Huma Qureshi (Mohsina) made a special appearance on the show. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The show was aired on 7–8 August 2012. [ 19 ]

As a part of the marketing campaign, the 'Wasseypur Patrika', a fictitious newspaper was made available online. [ 20 ]

Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2 received mostly positive reviews.

Mayank Shekhar rated the movie 4/5 stars on Dainik Bhaskar [ 21 ] and his review at theW14.com reads, ""This is India's equivalent of; take your pick, Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in America (1984), or Robert Rodriguez's Once Upon A Time in Mexico (2003), though I suppose it could possibly be better than both. It's the definitive ""litti western"" to borrow the stock phrase ""spaghetti western"" for Leone's film. With 320 minutes broken into two parts, allows Kashyap the scope to seriously self-indulge and unabashedly entertaining. The reason you prefer this sequel to the first installment, besides it being more contemporary is, well, this is where the beginning ties up with the end. You get a full sense of the film's ambitions."" [ 22 ]

Jaykumar Shah of PlanetBollywood.com gave the movie 8.5/10 stars, saying that ""All in all, this is the best movie to come out from India this year so far. It is a gritty, well-paced, extremely well-acted, genre defining, path breaking work of art. The movie is not for the ones who are not comfortable with violence being depicted graphically. If you can digest violence on screen, it is a sure winner."" [ 23 ]

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4/5 stars, saying that ""On the whole, Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2 is an Anurag Kashyap show all through and without an iota of doubt, can easily be listed as one amongst his paramount works. An engaging movie with several bravura moments. Watch it for its absolute cinematic brilliancy!"" [ 24 ]

Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the movie 4/5 stars, stating that ""The revenge, filmed with an operatic slo-mo rhythm, is bloodier than anything you would have seen before. But if you liked Gangs of Wasseypur , there is no reason why won't have another blast watching Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2 . But be warned: be sure that your stomach for blood and gore doesn't give way."" [ 25 ]

Blessy Chettiar of DNA India gave the movie 4/5 stars, commenting that ""Guns speak where abusive language fails. Patience and a real kaleja will see you through this fast-paced, exhilarating blood fest. Kashyap makes sure the gore is beyond redemption. If you're turned off by it, not his fault."" [ 26 ]

Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India gave the movie 4/5 stars, saying that ""With excellent performances, a screenplay that's strung together beautifully (Zeishan Quadri, Akhilesh, Sachin Ladia, Anurag Kashyap) a revenge story that touches a dramatic crescendo and music that plays out perfectly in sync with tragic twists of the tale – ' GOW II' is an interesting watch, for the brave-hearted. Like the first part, the movie slows down at times (with pointless pistols, hordes of characters and wasted sub-plots); the length needs to be shot down desperately. But otherwise, it's revenge on a platter – served cold (heartedly) and definitely worth a 'second' helping."" [ 27 ]

Ananya Bhattacharya of Zee News gave the movie 4/5 stars, concluding that ""While watching 'Wasseypur', the entire film takes your life away! Gangs of Wasseypur 2 is a film, which, with its predecessor, is one that is here to stay, to break conceptions, to demolish structures. With the history of Wasseypur, 'Wasseypur' has created another history."" [ 28 ]

Raja Sen of Rediff gave the movie 3.5/5 stars, stating that ""Anurag Kashyap shines once again in the concluding part of Gangs of Wasseypur even though the film is a tad too long. For all its folly – and the fact that an hour could have been lopped off its running length, easy – Gangs of Wasseypur II provides enough cinematic memorabilia to single-handedly last us the summer."" [ 29 ]

International critics have given Gangs of Wasseypur , the first mainstream Bollywood film to be selected for the Director's Fortnight, rave reviews following its world premiere at the 65th Cannes Film Festival. Gangs of Wasseypur premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival on the evening of 22 May 2012 as the most highly anticipated Indian film. Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter called the film ""an extraordinary ride through Bollywood's spectacular, over-the-top filmmaking"".

Kashyap, whose reputation as a screenwriter and controversial director reach a culmination in this film, is the real behind-the-scenes godfather, never losing control over the story-telling or hundreds of actors, and allowing tongue-in-cheek diversions in the second half that confirm his command over the sprawling material. In the spirit of Bollywood, Rajiv Ravi's lensing is fast on its feet, with a continually moving camera that always seems to be in the right spot to capture the action. Referring to the violence and pace of the film she says "" Gangs of Wasseypur puts Tarantino in a corner with its cool command of cinematically inspired and referenced violence, ironic characters and breathless pace"". [ 30 ]

Maggie Lee of Variety notes Kashyap never lets his diverse influences of old-school Italo-American mafia classics a la Coppola, Scorsese and Leone, as well as David Michod's taut crime thriller ""Animal Kingdom,"" override the distinct Indian colour. Calling the film ""the love child of Bollywood and Hollywood,"" she felt the film was ""by turns pulverizing and poetic in its depiction of violence."" [ 31 ]

Lee Marshall of Screen International writes ""the script alternates engagingly between scenes of sometimes stomach-churning violence and moments of domestic comedy, made more tasty by hard-boiled lines of dialogue like ""in Wasseypur even the pigeons fly with one wing, because they need the other to cover their arse"" "". He describes song lyrics ""as if mouthed by a Greek chorus of street punks"" commenting sarcastically on what's happening onscreen. [ 32 ]

Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2 collected ₹15.44 crore in the first weekend and ₹17.80 crore by end of first week. Film ended with a total collection of ₹22.04 crore . [ 3 ]

The film mainly draws its story from the real life gang wars that took place in the region of Dhanbad, Jharkhand .

The character of Ramadhir Singh is based on Suryadeo Singh . In the film's climax, Singh is brutally killed by Faizal Khan but in real life, Surajdeo Singh was poisoned in his native village during an election campaign in June 1991. Allegedly, Suresh Singh had him poisoned both to avenge the murder of BP Sinha and so that Suresh could become the undisputed coal king of Dhanbad. [ citation needed ]

The character of Faizal Khan is based on Fahim Khan. The latter was not killed but is currently in jail in Hazaribagh , sentenced to life imprisonment. [ 33 ]

The character of Faizal Khan's friend Fazlu is based on Sabir Alam. In the film, Fazlu is killed and decapitated by Faizal. While Sabir and Fahim Khan were also childhood friends turned enemies, Sabir was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007 for the murder of Fahim Khan's mother and aunt (who in the film where murdered by Sultan Qureshis' men), but was out on bail in Wasseypur as of 2013. [ 34 ]

The mafia's downfall in Dhanbad didn't come from gang wars but rather it came from the differences between Kunti Singh, the widow of Surajdeo Singh, and his three brothers – Baccha Singh, Rajan Singh and Ram Dhani Singh – which gave others an opportunity to make space for themselves.

Dhoom 3,tt1833673,"In 1990, Iqbal Haroon Khan, who owns The Great Indian Circus in Illinois , is ordered by the Western Bank of Chicago to close down the circus as he cannot repay his loan. Dejected, Iqbal commits suicide in front of his young son Sahir Iqbal Khan and the officials, including Chairman Warren Anderson.

In 2013, Sahir robs various branches of the Western Bank of Chicago as revenge. Despite all efforts of law enforcement , the Chicago Police are unable to capture him. Detective Victoria calls A.C.P Jai Dixit and Sub Inspector Ali Akbar Fateh Khan for  help. Sahir restarts The Great Indian Circus and hires Aaliya Hussain as an acrobat. Sahir poses as an informant for Jai and manages to gather information on the bank while providing Jai with a false lead to follow. Eventually, Sahir robs the bank, but Jai shoots him in the left shoulder before he disappears.

At The Great Indian Circus 's grand premiere, Sahir performs a teleportation trick in which he disappears and reappears in a different place. The show becomes a success. After the show, Jai, Ali, and the police surround him. When Sahir is examined, there is no gunshot wound on his body. It is then revealed that Sahir has an autistic twin brother, Samar Iqbal Khan, who helps him pull off the tricks and robberies and is the one who sustained the gunshot wound. Jai is fired from the case but is encouraged by Ali to prove Sahir guilty by going rogue.

Jai finds out about Samar, who is kept in seclusion by Sahir and is allowed outdoors once a week. Jai manages to befriend him during this time, intending to use him to catch Sahir. Samar falls in love with Aaliya, while Sahir finds out about Jai using his brother. Sahir tricks Jai and almost kills him, but Ali saves him. Sahir and Samar successfully pull off their final bank heist, but are cornered at a dam on their way out of town. Samar hesitates to run when Aaliya appears, begging him to stop. Sahir pretends to surrender to Jai, asking him to spare Samar; when Jai agrees, Sahir attempts to jump off the dam- but Samar grabs Sahir's hand, and he begs Samar to let him go, saying Samar can live freely with Aaliya. Samar declares that they were born together and should die together, and lets go of his hand, and the twins fall to their deaths.
In the aftermath, Western Bank of Chicago is shut down due to the heists, while Aaliya takes over The Great Indian Circus and performs in Samar's memory.

Prior to principal photography , the film enjoyed widespread media coverage [ 14 ] due to the tremendous box office successes [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] of previous instalments Dhoom 2 and Dhoom as well as the confirmation of Aamir Khan as the film's lead antagonist, thereby creating anticipation amongst audience and media. [ 18 ] On 2 January 2011, the producer of the previous Dhoom films Aditya Chopra, confirmed that the third instalment of the Dhoom series would begin principal photography by the end of 2011. Initially, the producers and Khan wanted to release the film on Christmas of 2012, [ 19 ] but the plan was scrapped in favour of an early release date in 2013, mainly due to a forecast that a Christmas release would force a rushed post-production schedule, which was considered unfavorable given the high degree of technicality required for the film. [ 20 ] Around ₹ 1.25 billion (US$21.33 million) was spent just on the production side of Dhoom 3 . [ 21 ]

Reportedly, Chopra wanted to make the film in 3D after observing the successes of previous Bollywood films released in this format. However, actor Aamir Khan opined that the 3D technology needed expertise and was unsure of the outcome of its utilisation by the director. [ 22 ] As of September 2012 [update] , YRF Studios had not announced the production of the film in 3D. [ 23 ]

Apart from Aamir Khan joining the cast as the lead antagonist , while Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra were confirmed to reprise their roles as Jai Dixit and Ali Akbar respectively. [ 24 ] Khan learned ballet, [ citation needed ] aerobatics [ 25 ] and the French technique of parkour , [ 26 ] a method of movement focused on negotiating obstacles with speed and efficiency, while Kaif took paragliding training and singing lessons. [ 27 ] Bachchan reportedly lost nine kilos of weight to prepare for his role in the film. [ 28 ] Rimi Sen , who played ACP Jai Dixit's (character played by Abhishek Bachchan) wife in the previous two instalments of the series, was not approached to play her character Sweety. However, she stated that she would not have reprised the role even if she were offered. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]

Unlike the first two Dhoom films directed by Sanjay Gadhvi , Vijay Krishna Acharya , the writer of all three instalments of Dhoom , was roped in to direct Dhoom 3 [ 24 ] although Gadhvi himself said that he wanted to get involved with films outside the franchise and thus chose not to direct the third film. [ 31 ] Olliver Keller was signed to direct the stunt scenes. [ 32 ]

Aamir Khan stated in an interview that his role in Dhoom 3 is the toughest role so far in his life. [ 33 ] The action scenes were directed by Conrad Palmisano and Sham Kaushal. [ 34 ] In an interview with IANS , Abhishek Bachchan expressed how every character of Dhoom 3 is significant: ""... Dhoom is my film and I am the hero. Nobody can take that away from me. You can be the biggest or the smallest star but Dhoom is about Jai and Ali. It is as simple as that. If the characters of Jai and Ali are not there in Dhoom , the film won't be there."" [ 35 ]

On 23 September 2013, three months before the actual release of the film, DNA and other media news publications revealed that Aamir Khan could play a double role in Dhoom 3 , but they did not confirm it. [ 36 ] The dual role was only confirmed at the release of the film. This made Dhoom 3 the first and currently the only film in the series in which the antagonist has a double role. However, this was not the first time the series featured a double role, since Bipasha Basu had a double role in Dhoom 2 as Shonali and Monali, but they did not share the same screen space, unlike Khan's characters.

Filming was scheduled to commence from November 2011, with scenes involving Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra being shot first, [ 37 ] but the former was off on a paternity leave, so shooting was postponed to January 2012. The schedule was then pushed to June because of lead actor Aamir's prior commitments with his TV show Satyamev Jayate ; in June, the filming schedule was further postponed for a month because Khan wanted to prepare himself for his role of a gymnast. Khan also wanted to concentrate on the marketing and promotion of his 2012 film Talaash . [ 38 ] Without any further delays, filming commenced with Jackie Shroff and Siddharth Nigam , the child actor playing child Sahir, on 8 June 2012 at the YRF Studios in Mumbai . [ 39 ]

Aamir Khan joined the crew in July 2012, filming for five days at Yash Raj Studios and further continued to shoot in Chicago and other parts of the United States. Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, and Uday Chopra flew to the US on 4 August 2012 to complete a three-month schedule. On arrival in India in December 2012, Bachchan stated that fifty percent of filming was complete and would again resume in Mumbai . [ 40 ]

In the second week of March 2013, it was reported that the crew had departed to Zurich and Ticino , Switzerland to film the climax. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The shooting of the film finally wrapped up on 14 September 2013 at a suburban studio in Mumbai. [ 43 ]

The climactic scene in Dhoom 3 was shot at the famous arch dam , Contra Dam (commonly known as the Verzasca Dam) in Ticino , Switzerland. [ 44 ] It is the same dam that became a popular bungee jumping venue after a James Bond stuntman jumped off it in the opening scene of the 1995 film GoldenEye . [ 45 ]

It was announced that the composer of Dhoom and Dhoom 2 ; Pritam , would return once again to compose the music of the third instalment. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Earlier reports suggested that Shefali Alvares had been roped to sing the Dhoom title track, but this turned out to be a rumour. [ 49 ] Aamir said in a statement that the title track ""Dhoom Machale Dhoom"" is dedicated to Sachin Tendulkar who was then playing his 200th and final test match at the Wankhede Stadium . [ 50 ]

In November 2013, Aditya Chopra sent out a message to movie exhibitors all over the country to ""Go digital or miss Dhoom 3 ."" In detailed statements, he claimed, ""Release of movies through digital and UFO digital cinema prevents piracy as the prints are water-marked and finger-printed and can be traced back. It is believed that usually films are copied for piracy when the reels are being transported to theatres in the country and abroad. Digital cinema curbs piracy as the 'en route' content leakage is eliminated. It also makes sense economically as a producer saves a lot of print costs. Apart from that, encrypting the content protects the copyrights of the producers and distributors. Digital prints prevent duplication of prints and help by diverting funds back to the cinemas."" [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ]

IMAX Corporation and Yash Raj Films announced that Dhoom:3 would be the first Indian local language production to be released in the IMAX format .

[ 221 ] Srijana Mitra Das of the Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars. Especially praising the actors' performances, she wrote, "" Dhoom 3 makes you laugh, gasp – even sniffle"". [ 222 ] Aparna Mudi of Zee News gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and remarked "" Dhoom 3 manages to deliver a typically Bollywood revenge saga in a modern way."" [ 223 ] Sarita A Tanwar of Daily News and Analysis also gave it 4 stars and commented, ""Welcome to the world of jaw-dropping action and stunts never seen before on Hindi screen. Dhoom 3 redefines the word 'entertainment' in the grandest way possible."" [ 224 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV , on the other hand, gave it 3 out of 5 stars and noted that "" Dhoom: 3 is a high-voltage action flick that relies squarely on known methods of the genre"". [ 225 ] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, "" Dhoom 3 continues the tradition of extravagance in adventure and expenditure by roping in the fastidious Aamir Khan as its latest star antagonist"". [ 226 ] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare rated it 3 out of 5 stars; though he labelled it a ""slick looking film"", he felt ""the force driving them, the story, teeters on abysmal points"". [ 227 ] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 stars and wrote, ""The third installment...is bigger and more plot-heavy than the first two."" [ 228 ] The Indo-Asian News Service review, syndicated by Business Standard , also gave it 3 stars, writing, "" Dhoom 3 is an intriguing piece of work... slender supple smart and subtle...and yet helmed by a central performance that screams for attention."" [ 229 ]

Dhoom 3 also received negative reviews as well. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated "" Dhoom 3 is let down by a convenient script and its inability to deliver solid entertainment"". He described the film as a ""sloppily scripted sandwich of hammy acting and cheesy dialogue"" that lacked the ""thrills"" of the previous films. [ 232 ] Raja Sen of Rediff gave it 1.5 out of 5 stars. Criticizing the villain's motivations and the ""yawn-worthy chase scenes"" that were ""both pointless and badly edited"", he deemed Dhoom 3 ""a children's film made for children who've never seen a film"". [ 233 ] Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express gave the film 2 stars out of 5. She praised the ""superb cinematography, great-looking sets, expansive foreign locations"", however she also found the film to be ""a victim of both a crying lack of imagination and franchise fatigue"". Gupta also felt that Khan lacked the ""sexy-badness"" required for the villain, and noted Kaif's minimal role. [ 234 ] Rohit Khilnani of India Today heavily criticised Dhoom 3 and gave it 2 stars out of 5, calling it ""full of loopholes, over-the-top acting and an overdose of action that doesn't fit well all the time"". He found that the film's only redeeming factor was that it was ""a visual treat"" due to its exotic locales and special effects. [ 235 ] Rafay Mahmood of The Express Tribune rated the film as 1.5 out of 5, noting the ""overdose of one-liners"", lack of ""a properly connected cause-and-effect chain"", and the ""over-the-top action sequences"" that ""build-up to nothing dramatically significant"". He, in particular, criticised the actors' performances. Mahmood called Kaif ""eye candy"" with little dialogue, and felt Khan gave ""perhaps the worst performance of his career"". [ 236 ]

Meanwhile, the film garnered praise from foreign film critics.

David Chute of Variety liked the camera work, action, stunts, and Aamir's performance: ""Acharya's camera seems to be dancing – and swooning – along with the performers... High-flying acrobatics and a standout Aamir Khan performance dominate the third entry in Bollywood's biggest action franchise."" [ 237 ] According to Bill Stamets of Chicago Sun-Times , "" Dhoom:3 is crowd-pleasing populist fare"" that ""entertains as a spectacle of chases, bank capers, magic acts and song-and-dance numbers"". [ 238 ] A number of critics noted that Dhoom 3 has several similarities with Christopher Nolan 's films The Prestige and The Dark Knight . [ 239 ] [ 240 ] [ 241 ] [ 242 ]

The film has garnered the inaugural Telstra People's Choice Award at the 2014 Indian Film Festival of Melbourne . [ 257 ]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Dhoom_3_Film_Poster.jpg/220px-Dhoom_3_Film_Poster.jpg

The politicians chase PP and AIDS into a warehouse where eventually the police arrive and Monsoon realises that the men were telling the truth all this while.

Singham Returns,tt2309764,"Bajirao Singham, who is now a DCP , gets transferred to Mumbai and discovers that one of his team members, Mahesh Jadhav, is found dead inside an ambulance with massive bags of money. Singham decides to unearth the truth behind it and in this process, he collides with a powerful and fraudulent religious leader , Satyaraj ""Babaji"" Chander, who has high-profile connections with corrupt politicians , including the ruling party's secretary minister Prakash Rao. During this period, Gurukant ""Guruji"" Acharya, the veteran leader of the ruling party who has been a teacher to Chief Minister Vikram Adhikari and Singham, is killed by Babaji's henchmen due to Guruji's opposition to Rao's scheme, even though Singham was present at the scene, making him vow vengeance. Because of this, he has to pretend that he has resigned in front of his family. Due to this, his father Manikrao asks him and his childhood friend, Avni Kamat, to come to their home town, Shivgarh .

After some time, Singham and Avni fall in love with each other. However, it is then revealed that Singham hasn't resigned and came to Shivgarh on an undercover mission to find evidence against Babaji. At Wadhavpur, he catches Babaji's henchman named Altaf Khan who distributes the black money in order to bribe the voters. While coming to Mumbai with a convoy, it is attacked by Babaji's henchmen and Altaf is shot and slips into coma. On the other hand, Rao harms all of Guruji's candidates, including Avni, because her in-hiding brother Kishore is one of the candidates. Singham manages to save Avni and during a political event, the female family members of the candidates slap Rao due to this act. Altaf soon recovers and testifies against him. Singham arrests Babaji and Rao, leading to riots. However, some party workers execute an attack outside the court, killing the witnesses . This causes Babaji and Rao to go scot-free due to lack of evidence. Realizing the futility of the law, Singham and his team reach their house without wearing their police uniforms, joined in by police from all around Mumbai.

They successfully fight Babaji and Rao's men. Singham's team storm inside Babaji's house, and comically torture Babaji and Rao by firing a live round into both of their buttocks each. The wounded and humiliated Rao and Baba tell the truth, their confessions secretly being filmed and broadcast on live television and radio. A few weeks later, Guruji's party wins the elections. While being transported to jail in a van, Rao and Baba once again threaten and taunt Singham. Suddenly, the van stops and the driver walks away. A water tanker crashes into the van, sending it into a power station, killing both of them. One of Singham's allies, Inspector Dev Phadnis tells the media that there was a brake failure, and the incident is deemed as an accident (a plan that was fabricated by Singham which resembled the way Mahesh was killed).

Director Rohit Shetty announced his thoughts on making a sequel to one of his finest movies Singham (2011). After filming Chennai Express with Shah Rukh Khan , Shetty reportedly has begun filming for Singham 2 with the lead star Ajay Devgn .

[ 17 ] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 4 stars and said ""The film is a complete mass entertainer with power-packed drama, hi-intensity dialogue and towering performances as its aces.

[ 19 ] Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and said, ""This is one of Shetty's least cartoonish films. Which doesn't mean he's going for Ardh Satya -style realism.

[ 21 ] Shubra Gupta of the Indian Express gave 1.5 stars and said ""The sequel to 'Singham' is chock full of the usual car on jeep action. Explosions go off at regular intervals.

[ 23 ] Raja Sen of Rediff gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and said, ""The problem with Singham (and, for that matter, any of these uninteresting modern day star-vehicles) is that the hero roams about unchallenged, unopposed, unexciting. The hero himself ain't bad – for whatever that's worth. Ajay Devgn wears his scowl like a wrestler would wear a championship belt, proud and unsmiling. He's got a fine, old-school swagger and his ass-kicking looks relatively authentic."" [ 24 ]

Horror Story (film),tt3177332,"Vikrant Nerula enters alone the deserted Grandiose Hotel. He proceeds to Room 3046 and commits suicide by jumping off the terrace.

Seven friends, Sam (Samraat), Maghhesh, Achint, Neel, Nina, Sonia, and Maggie, reunite in a local pub after several years to celebrate the farewell of Neel, who is going abroad. They learn about an abandoned hotel that was initially a mental asylum for the criminally insane but was almost destroyed in a fire. The ruins were refurbished into a five-star hotel. Rumours state that the hotel owner was pushed into suicide by the ghost of an asylum inmate.

They try to enter the hotel through the main door, but they enter through the back door as it is locked. Nina observes strange phenomena, but Neel brushes her claims aside. They find a TV set on with no transmission or power. Following this, Achint and Neel hear a voice saying, ""WELCOME TO DIE."" Ignoring it as a hallucination, they proceed to Room 3046, where Sam is killed. The group flees in panic and realises that they are trapped inside the hotel with no way out. Achint and Maghhesh go to the terrace to try and find a mobile signal, but a spirit kills Maghhesh.

A woman's ghost then terrorises the group, which drags Sonia into darkness. With three people dead, the remaining four find an abandoned Jeep which they use to try to get out of the hotel amidst ghostly apparitions. After a drive through misty areas, the group escapes, only to find that they are back at the door of Room 3046. They realise that the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.

However, Sonia soon confronts them, whom Achint and Neel think is the ghost, but a tearful Sonia tells them that it is really her. The group learns that when the hotel was a mental asylum, a possessed girl named Maya was admitted after she murdered her entire family. Maya would always claim to have 'married the devil' and become very violent at the hospital, even killing the doctors and causing the fire that broke out and killed all the inmates. The group thus realises that it is Maya who is haunting them.

Sonia attempts to contact Maya to find out what she wants. She receives a call from Maya, who says she wants to kill them all and nothing else. Afterwards, Maya's spirit kills Sonia. Nina asks the time from Neel, only to be told that it is the same time (3:55 a.m.) she had seen on the clock in one of the rooms shortly after entering the hotel. Believing it is an intuition, they decide to go back to the same room to understand Nina's extrasensory perception.

There they find a book containing paranormal explanations and a way to locate the source of energy of the dark spirits. With the help of incantations from the book, they have visions of the past. They see that the hotel was a mental asylum and find that the source of energy for Maya's spirit is in a shock machine. They decide to burn it down to end the horror.

Neel and Maggie go to the kitchen in search of something flammable. Maggie sees a female spirit sitting on a chair and reading a newspaper. Afterwards, Maya's spirit, appearing in the form of Neel, kills Maggie. Achint is beheaded by the spirit, leaving only Neel and Nina alive.

Neel tries to burn the machine, but the spirit pulls him into a closet. The spirit starts terrorizing Nina. Nina starts a fire. Amidst ghostly apparitions and obstructions, and with the help of the spirit of Vikrant Narula (the previous owner of the hotel), she manages to burn the machine, destroying Maya's spirit. The film ends with the entrance doors of the hotel opening at dawn and a traumatized Nina, the only survivor, walking outside.

Of the film, Bhatt has stated that he did not want Horror Story to contain any songs or sex scenes. [ 4 ] He also remarked that he wanted to avoid casting ""big stars"" in the film, as he believed that they ""cannot turn the audience fearful"" in what he termed a ""hardcore horror film"". [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Ravish Desai has commented that the movie will be the first in a franchise and that planning for further films has already begun. [ 6 ]

Bhatt had earlier made films in the same genre, namely 1920 , 1920: Evil Returns and Haunted . In an interview, he commented, ""While [my] Raaz 3 and 1920 were romantic sagas with songs and full-on drama, this one is more of a Hollywood kind of drama. The horror lies in the story.""

Raman Raghav 2.0,tt5662932,"In 2013, Assistant Commissioner of Police Raghavan Amrendra Singh Umbi, a drug addict, visits a Mumbai drug dealer. However, his plan to purchase drugs is foiled—the dealer and another man have been murdered. Investigating the murders the next day, he receives a hammer followed by an anonymous phone call.

In 2015, a man named Ramanna surrenders to the police and confesses to killing nine people. He is detained and beaten by the police but manages to escape with the help of a group of boys nearby. Seeking food at the home of his sister Lakshmi, Ramanna argues with his brother-in-law. After leaving the house he quickly returns and kills the couple and their son. Raghavan is among the police who later investigated the family's murder, where he finds a picture of Ramanna with Lakshmi, confirming Ramanna's involvement in the crime.

Raghavan is in a relationship with Smrutika ""Simi"" Naidu, but he is an abusive partner: he beats her and has forced her to have three abortions. Ramanna surveils Raghavan and Simi, suggesting a link exists between the cop and the killer. This surveillance escalates into more murders when Ramanna stalks and kills Simi's maid and her husband. After these killings, Ramanna is caught by the police with assistance from an onlooker. However, Ramanna escapes from custody again and kills the man who aided his capture. Raghavan proves to be a killer himself when, after a trip to visit his father, he murders an African drug dealer.

That evening Raghavan picks up a woman named Ankita at a nightclub and brings her to Simi's house. Incapacitated by drug use, Raghavan is unable to perform sexually, prompting mockery from Ankita. In response he assaults her. Still enraged, he searches for the stash of drugs he keeps at the house but is unable to find it. In this state he confronts Simi and they argue. When Simi demands he leave with Ankita, he strikes Simi; her head hits a glass table killing her instantly.

Ankita locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call for help, but desists when Raghavan threatens and coerces her. He then clears away incriminating evidence and arranges the scene to implicate Ramanna for the murder. He retrieves a tyre iron similar to Ramanna's favored murder weapon and smashes Simi's head with it. During these preparations, Ankita escapes.

The next day Ramanna surrenders to Raghavan and claims a deep connection with him: each man is the missing half of the other. Ramanna also reveals his role in the two 2013 murders that opened the film and initiated this connection. He confesses to one of the killings but witnessed Raghavan kill the other man, and thus began his surveillance of the policeman. Ramanna offers to accept the charge for Simi's murder, but only if Raghavan will kill the eyewitness, Ankita. In the final scene Raghavan's descent into evil matches Ramanna's when he murders Ankita in her home.

Raman Raghav 2.0 was inspired by the notorious serial killer Raman Raghav , who had killed several homeless people in Mumbai during the late 1960s. [ 4 ] Bludgeoning his victims, he produced widespread panic until he was captured by the Mumbai police and confessed to 41 murders. [ 5 ] Raghav was sentenced to death by the Bombay High Court , but his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia allowed his defence to claim mental incapability and gain a change of sentence to life imprisonment. [ 6 ] [ 5 ] He was sent to Yerawada Central Jail , where he died of kidney failure in 1988 after 19 years of incarceration. [ 6 ]

Director Anurag Kashyap first became interested in the story of Raman Raghav in 1991, when Sriram Raghavan was making a 68-minute film about the killer titled Raman Raghav, A City, A Killer . Kashyap was drawn to the idea of a criminal who was not motivated by familiar human vices. According to him, the killer had ""no moral compass or planning"" to kill someone. [ 6 ] He initially wanted to make a trilogy of period films based in Mumbai, the first of which was Bombay Velvet (2015), then a film on the Nanavati murder case after Raman Raghav 2.0 . But after the commercial failure of Bombay Velvet , Kashyap realised that he would not get producers for another period film. He then set the film in contemporary time. [ 6 ] The film on the Nanavati case did not materialise. [ 6 ] Vasan Bala, the film's co-writer, had written a biopic about Raman Raghav. Kashyap re-wrote that script, taking inspiration from the actual murders. [ 7 ] He created a police officer who would be the ""mirror image"" of the killer, as he felt it was difficult to create an honest cop in a contemporary time. [ 6 ]

Kashyap said that Nawazuddin Siddiqui was his first casting choice for the film because of his ""unimposing body"". Kashyap modelled the character on Raghubir Yadav , who had portrayed Raman Raghav in Sriram Raghavan's 1991 film. [ 6 ] Siddiqui left his home for two days without informing anyone and started to ""fear himself"" while preparing for the role. [ 8 ]

Vicky Kaushal was called by Kashyap and was given two scenes to prepare in five days for the audition. Kaushal locked himself in the room and isolated himself from phone, internet and newspaper and kept repeating his lines from the scenes. [ 9 ] He then gave the audition and was selected for the role of Raghav. [ 9 ] Miss Earth India 2013, Sobhita Dhulipala made her acting debut with this film. [ 10 ] She had got a call for audition from the casting director Mukesh Chhabra , where she was eventually selected. [ 11 ]

Principal photography began in September 2015 and was completed on 22 November 2015. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Kashyap wrote smaller scenes: ""Normal Hindi films have 70 scenes, my films have 220 scenes"". [ 15 ] He mentioned that it helped in making the film look vast as the locations kept changing. The title was decided before the script was ready. [ 15 ] The crew employed guerrilla filmmaking technique to shoot in real locations of Mumbai. [ 16 ] Siddiqui had to deliver a ten-minute monologue in the film. To maintain continuity , he had to be still at the same place while the camera setup was changed from different angles. [ 17 ] As a result, he ended up speaking for 300 minutes in the same position. After the shoot, the actor experienced a blackout and could not talk for sometime. [ 17 ] Kaushal's character is shown snorting cocaine throughout the film. To make a quasi-cocaine powder, the crew used Glucon-D and Corn Starch. [ 18 ] Kaushal practised inhaling the powder for his scenes in the film. [ 18 ]

While shooting in some unhygienic surroundings, Siddiqui fell ill and was hospitalised for five days. His wife later said that Siddiqui was repeating his dialogues from the film, while being semi-conscious on bed. [ 16 ] Although the diagnosis showed dengue initially, he recovered quickly. [ 14 ] [ 16 ] He resumed shooting for the film when he was discharged. [ 14 ] Siddiqui called the shoot a ""mentally draining"" experience. [ 19 ] For a scene, the crew had to shoot it in the restricted area of the Mumbai airport which is guarded by snipers with strict instructions to shoot any infiltrator. Siddiqui was told not to move from his position and the scene was shot. [ 20 ] The visual effects and title sequence for the film were executed by Mumbai-based VFX and animation studio, Plexus. [ 21 ] Aarti Bajaj and Jay Pinak Oza served as the editor and director of photography respectively. [ 22 ] Raman Raghav 2.0 was distributed by Reliance Entertainment . [ 23 ]

The film's soundtrack and background score was composed by Ram Sampath , while the lyrics were penned by Varun Grover . Sona Mohapatra , Nayantara Bhatkal, Siddharth Basrur and Ram Sampath provided vocals for the album's songs. [ 24 ] The album rights were acquired by T-Series , and it was released on 3 June 2016. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]

On 24 April 2016, Kashyap released two teaser posters' of the film through his official Twitter account. [ 27 ] They showed a runnel of blood and a pistol attached to a tap. The first look was revealed on 25 April 2016, which had Siddiqui staring at the fourth wall with his red eyes. [ 28 ] A second poster was released on 1 May. [ 29 ] The first teaser of Raman Raghav 2.0 was launched on 6 May 2016, with a runtime of 46 seconds. [ 30 ] It was followed by three other teasers which showed a glimpse of the serial killer from the film. [ 31 ] The theatrical trailer of Raman Raghav 2.0 was released on 10 May 2016. [ 32 ] Before the theatrical release of the film, a series of comic strips were released showing the title character committing several crimes. [ 33 ] A user generated song ""I am Ramantic"" was released online which showed people from Mumbai and other cities, who shot their ten-second videos sporting the Raman Raghav 2.0 sunglasses. [ 34 ] The film released internationally with the title Psycho Raman . [ 21 ]

Raman Raghav 2.0 premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival , in the Directors' Fortnight section to positive response. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Siddiqui received a standing ovation post the screening of the film. [ 37 ] It also premiered at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival , [ 38 ] the Singapore International Film Festival , [ 39 ] the Fantasia International Film Festival , Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival and the 2016 Indian Film Festival of Melbourne . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Before the release, a special screening was held in Mumbai which was attended by actors like Kangana Ranaut , Shweta Tripathi and Abhishek Chaubey . [ 43 ] The film was released theatrically on 24 June 2016 in 770 screens across the country. [ 44 ] Raman Raghav 2.0 is also available on Netflix . [ 45 ] It was released as The Mumbai Murders on 21 November 2018 in France. [ 46 ]

Raman Raghav 2.0 received mostly positive response from critics upon its theatrical release. [ 47 ] Saibal Chattejee of NDTV praised the ""gripping, visceral genre film"",  and described the villain as ""a cross between No Country for Old Men' s Anton Chigurh and Se7en' s John Doe"". [ 48 ] Writing for The Hindu , Namrata Joshi called Raman Raghav 2.0 a ""taut thriller"" that ""takes you on an entertainment high."" [ 49 ] Anna M. M. Vetticad praised Siddiqui for his ""eerie, scary, [and] disgusting"" portrayal of the serial killer, and was particularly impressed by his ability to elicit laughs ""for the matter-of-fact manner in which he goes about his bloody business"". [ 50 ] Mohar Basu of The Times of India wrote, ""It is crude, callous and keeps you in suspense all through"". He felt that it was a difficult film to watch as it made the viewer ""queasy"". [ 51 ] Aseem Chhabra shared the view of the film being a ""difficult watch"". Although he was critical of the film's misogyny that made it a ""difficult film to admire"", he praised Siddiqui's performance at his ""creepiest best"". [ 52 ] Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times described the film as ""spine-chilling"" and ""pure sadism"". [ 53 ]

Contrary to the positive critical reviews, Rajeev Masand felt the film ""doesn't bring anything blazingly new or original to the serial killer genre."" [ 54 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote that the film was ""atmospheric yet hollow"" and the viewers are ""turned into cringing voyeurs, into reluctant participants, without redemption"". [ 55 ] Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today praised the film but felt that Dhulipala's character was the ""weak link"" as she ""doesn't have much to do"". [ 56 ]

The first two films have been highly successful. In order to shoot the third part of the trilogy, he goes to Malaysia , where he meets a London-based film maker Ayesha ( Jacqueline Fernandez ).

John Day (film),tt2699840,"John Day is a bank manager at Royal Citizen Co-operative Bank and lives with his wife Maria Day. The couple has recently lost their only daughter Pearl in a forest fire while she was on a trip with her boyfriend Kanishk. Maria is always depressed and never opens up with anyone. One day, when John is away for office work, a courier-boy enters the house and takes Maria as a captive. He then calls up John, informing him about his wife is a hostage, and tells him that a man will visit him at his bank and John has to do his work. It is shown that actually, it was a planned bank heist where the visitor gagged John, opened up the cash locker, and fled. Meanwhile, the kidnapper hammered Maria, causing her serious brain damage, and she got admitted to the hospital in a state of coma.

The news spread like wildfire on all TV channels. An impatient and short tempered Police Officer, Gautam, is shocked and calls his girlfriend Tabassum to collect a very important document stored in a locker of the bank. Inside the bank, the bank authorities, in the presence of the police, are giving away claims to bank customers, when Tabassum approaches and claims her documents which are revealed to be some property papers called ""CASABLANCA ESTATES"". This surprises John Day, and he follows the duo in his car and observes them depositing the file in a government property office. John bribes the office personnel and procures the original Casablanca files, and investigates.

During his investigation, he learns that police Officer Gautam also seeks the files and wants to sell them to a Mafia-based organization in Dubai. Gautam is under pressure from the Mafia to hand over the original documents of ""Casablanca Estates"". John vows to take revenge on the people who have injured his wife and actually eliminates all the informants, including the kidnapper, the bank robbers and others involved. He then takes Tabassum as a captive and calls Gautam, and another powerful Mafia Khan Saab at Gautam's place, and there, the truth is revealed.

Casablanca estate is nothing but 8000 acres of forest land being acquired illegally on papers by Mafia Lord Khan Saab and Dubai based Al Hunain, along with the help of Police Officer Gautam, who works for Khan. They had acquired the land, registered it with the insurance company, and then set fire to the jungle in order to get heavy compensation.

Meanwhile, Gautam has a plan to sell the papers for billions to the Dubai-based AG group and settle with his girlfriend abroad. When Khan is about to shoot Gautam for his treachery, Tabassum opens fire to save him. An ensuing shootout occurs in the room and results in Tabassum being killed, Khan and his associates, badly wounded and finally, Gautam being shot multiple times by John.

A Flying Jatt,tt5235880,"Wealthy and influential builder Mr. Rakesh Malhotra has built a factory on the shore of a lake into which pollutants and toxic waste are released. He wants to build a bridge across it for faster transportation. Still, he cannot do so due to a sacred tree present on the other side of the lake on a piece of land that belongs to Mrs. Dhillon, a religious but irrepressible Punjabi woman living with her son Aman Dhillon and his brother, Rohit Dhillon. Aman is a martial arts teacher in a school and has a crush on Kirti, a fellow teacher. After Malhotra fails to intimidate the Dhillon family into selling their land, he brings in Raka, a mercenary, to get the job done. Raka arrives at the tree with a chainsaw , but Aman is present there and tries to stop him. Raka beats Aman badly but moments, before he tries to decapitate him with the chainsaw, a lightning bolt hits the tree. The impact flings Raka away, and he lands amongst barrels of toxic waste outside Malhotra's factory.

The next morning, Aman finds himself in his bed alive with no sign of any injury and presumes all that happened to be a dream. He also notices a khanda that has appeared on his back, the same symbol which was carved on the tree and had been imprinted on him during the attack. Later that day, he and his brother notice a few unusual things happening to him, such as increased agility and the ability to absorb information by touching objects. After escaping an ambush using super speed, Rohit and his mother confirm that Aman has somehow gained superpowers. She immediately declares him a superhero. After making him a costume and showing him several superhero films for inspiration, Aman's mother tells him the story of his father, Sardar Kartar Singh Dhillon, a Sikh who went to Shaolin to learn martial arts and was named ""Flying Jatt"". She asks Aman to take up the legacy of his father and keep Flying Jatt as his superhero name to which he agrees. Although his superhero exploits get off to a rocky start, Flying Jatt is soon recognized when he saves hostages from a terrorist attack at an airport. As he gains even more success being a hero, Aman proposes to Kirti and reveals his secret identity to her.

Raka is found alive but is now stronger and more dangerous than before after being exposed to the pollutants at the factory, which further exposure continues to make him even more powerful. Aman goes on to battle him several times, beating Raka each time before finally becoming gravely injured in a brutal fight. To save him from further pain, his brother Rohit goes in his place as Flying Jatt and gets brutally beaten by Raka and dies. Aman and his mother are distraught with grief. The earth begins to slowly turn into a toxic wasteland and people begin to die due to the growing amount of pollution. An enraged Aman by his brother's death, Aman becomes and Sikh Sardar and decides to face Raka. Raka initially overpowers and knocks out Aman.

He subsequently cuts the latter's body into small pieces, and the duo borrows Prashant's car, drives to an isolated spot in Dahisar, and burns it. Before returning home, Robin instructs her not to tell anyone that he is in Mumbai. Days later, Prashant, Anju, and she attend Malad Police Station and notify Inspector Mane that Ashish is missing. After obtaining statements from the trio, the police launch an investigation to try and locate Ashish. Eventually, Mane suspects Anusha, summons her, questions and tortures her, she confesses, and is arrested. Robin is also subsequently arrested and brought to Mumbai, and both are produced in court.

The film received mixed reviews from critics.

The Sky Is Pink,tt8902990,"Aisha Chaudhary narrated the story of her parents Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from the afterlife . Aditi and Niren Chaudhary are a young couple who come from different backgrounds. The couple get married and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya Chaudhary, who dies within months of her birth due to the severe combined immunodeficiency condition.

Aditi and Niren have a second child named Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, a girl named Aisha. They later learn Aisha has the same medical condition as Tanya did and are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on Aisha's treatment, the couple go to London where they learn the disease could be treated with a very costly bone marrow transplant . Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren returns to India with his family and his son Ishaan.

Several years later, Aisha has recovered from her illness, and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India. They move to the outskirts of Delhi and buy a large, opulent bungalow. After collapsing at a party, Aisha is diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis , a side-effect of the chemotherapy she underwent. With Aisha's life shortened, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet, seeing aquatic life and writing a book. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows increasingly overprotective and stressed, and suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to ensure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies.

After the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Niren is angry and leaves for London while Aditi stays in India. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile by keeping the memories of Aisha.

The cast has been listed below: [ 5 ]

The production of The Sky Is Pink started when Aisha Chaudhary 's mother Aditi Chaudhary approached Shonali Bose to make a film about her daughter, who had seen the trailer of Bose's film Margarita with a Straw (2015) thirty times and was eager to watch the film, saying, ""I hope I live to see this film"". [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Aisha died of pulmonary fibrosis when she was 18, two weeks after watching the trailer; she did not live to see the film. Nine months later, Aditi Chaudhary tracked down Bose, who was living in Los Angeles . Aditi was adamant as she only wanted Bose to tell the story of her daughter. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Chaudhary and Bose interacted over Skype and later, Bose personally interviewed Aditi Chaudhary and Niren Chaudhary for eight hours a day for two weeks to gather all of the details of their story. [ 6 ] [ 9 ] Bose said the couple ""talked and cried and healed through the process of those narrations"". [ 6 ]

Bose said she was drawn towards the story because she had lost her son and so was ready to explore the subject in film and bring some of her own perspective to it. [ 10 ] Bose, however, preferred to tell the story of Aditi and Niren, a couple, dealing with their child's illness, saying that she was more interested in the story of parents dealing with their daughter's illness and not of a death-defying ""heroic teenager"". [ 7 ] Bose said she was ""intrigued and inspired"" by the relationship of the family, observing that they were a rare couple to stay together after the death of their child. [ 9 ] She said she ""wanted to explore what happens to a love story, to a marriage, when faced with the loss of a child"", noting that her own marriage ended after the death of her son, and that four out of five marriages dissolve after a child dies. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Bose wanted to make an ""unusual romantic film"" and the lives of Aditi and Niren fit the bill. [ 10 ]

Bose began writing the screenplay based on the Chaudharys' story, approaching it as a ""love story between two people who fell in love when they were only 16 and now at 57 are still inseparable and in love despite major tragedies that tear most couples apart"". [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Bose chose to tell the film from Aisha's point of view, focusing on 25 years of her parents' marriage and thus incorporating the first-person narrative . [ 11 ] Nilesh Maniyar, a longtime collaborator of Bose, had met Aditi and Niren, and wanted to make a documentary about Aisha because he felt there was more to explore. Maniyar saw Bose's film as very different than his, both projects being in different formats. Maniyar had also researched Aisha's life so Bose invited him to write the additional screenplay. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Juhi Chaturvedi wrote the Hindi dialogue. [ 13 ]

Bose wanted to stay true to the real-life events and depict them as they unfolded without fictionalizing or deflecting from real incidents. She said, ""I wrote the script as close as possible to the truth. So, when deciding the look and feel of the film, I decided to stay with realism and be as authentic as possible."" [ 7 ] [ 9 ] While writing the script, Bose met with and interviewed Aisha's family and friends. She also read Aisha's writing, including her emails to her brother and the artwork she made. Bose said she felt connected with Aisha even though they never met. [ 9 ] Bose chose to be realistic and to avoid melodramatic and manipulative set-ups to express emotions. [ 7 ] She said that she wanted to keep clear of melodrama and not exploit the audience by causing ""overwrought emotions"", instead wanting them ""to feel what [the] characters feel but also give [them] space."" [ 9 ] In an interview with Scroll.in , Bose said Aditi was the main protagonist in early drafts because she was the central figure in the story, but she later strengthened Niren's role so that they were equals in the final draft. [ 9 ]

Siddharth Roy Kapur liked Bose's previous film and had expressed his desire to work with her. [ 14 ] After the acquisition of UTV Motion Pictures by The Walt Disney Company , Kapur was appointed managing director of The Walt Disney Company India in 2014 and produced several films under the new name. Kapur established his own company, Roy Kapur Films, in January 2017. [ 14 ] When Bose found out about his new production house, she approached him with the script of The Sky Is Pink and Kapur chose it to be his company's first film. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Kapur said he found the script wonderfully moving, told with humour, depth and feeling. [ 15 ] As part of a first look deal with RSVP Movies , Kapur set the film there, collaborating with Ronnie Screwvala , the ex-UTV Studio head, as producers. [ 14 ] In December 2018, Ivanhoe Pictures became involved to co-finance and co-produce the film. [ 16 ] Mikey McCleary composed the background score of the film. [ 5 ] Bose considers The Sky Is Pink the culmination of her Delhi trilogy, a series of unrelated films based on ""mother-child relationship"" and that are set in Delhi; the other first two films being Amu (2005) and Margarita with a Straw . [ 17 ] The Sky Is Pink 's title comes from a real incident that is shown in the film. [ 6 ] [ 10 ]

Bose's first choice for the lead role was Priyanka Chopra Jonas , who she had in mind while writing the script. It took six months for Bose to contact Chopra Jonas, whose manager did not give her the script to read. [ 7 ] [ 18 ] According to Bose, Aditi Chaudhary had asked her to make a big Hindi film about her daughter but Roy Kapur initially thought it should be an independent film. [ 7 ] [ 18 ] He suggested Bose should get a well-known film actor first if she wanted to make the film on a bigger budget. Bose told him she wanted Chopra Jonas as Aditi and then asked him to contact her and send her a copy of the script, which he did. [ 7 ] [ 18 ] When Chopra Jonas read the script, she wanted to meet Bose and immediately agreed to appear in the film. [ citation needed ] She was the first actor to be cast in the film. [ 18 ] For Aisha, Maniyar suggested Zaira Wasim , who immediately accepted the offer. [ 7 ]

The film's casting news first appeared in the media in May 2018, suggesting Chopra Jonas, Abhishek Bachchan and Zaira Wasim had been cast in Bose's next untitled project. The media reports suggested Wasim had been cast as Aisha Chaudhary with Chopra and Bachchan playing her character's parents. [ 19 ] A month later, media reports said Farhan Akhtar , who was also one of Bose's top choices, had replaced Bachchan and would be playing the father. [ 7 ] [ 20 ] Chopra Jonas confirmed her involvement in the film on 9 July 2018 by posting a picture of the script of The Sky Is Pink on her Instagram account, revealing the film's title. [ 13 ] The official announcement followed the next day, confirming Akhtar's and Wasim's casting in the film. [ 21 ]

The Sky Is Pink is the second film to feature Chopra Jonas and Akhtar opposite each other after Dil Dhadakne Do (2015). [ 21 ] Bose had said Aisha's brother Ishaan was the most difficult character to cast; the casting directors auditioned hundred boys for the part. [ 7 ] Finally, Rohit Suresh Saraf was cast after four rounds of auditions over four months. [ 7 ] [ 22 ] The Sky Is Pink marked the return of Chopra Jonas to Bollywood films after three years being busy with her Hollywood work. [ 23 ] After accepting her role in the film, Chopra Jonas asked Kapur and Screwvala to join them as the producer because she believed in the film, wanted to take more responsibility for it and learn about producing from them. [ 23 ] Kapur and Screwvala, both frequent collaborators of Chopra Jonas, who had starred in several of their films under UTV, agreed to engage Chopra Jonas as a producer, making The Sky Is Pink making the first Hindi film to be produced under her company Purple Pebble Pictures . [ 23 ] Bose had organized workshops for the actors, who did several rehearsals before the start of filming. [ 6 ] [ 24 ]

Chopra Jonas was drawn to the film because of the story and the way it was written, saying she found the treatment of a heavy subject with humour refreshing and beautiful. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Chopra Jonas found her character Aditi immersive and described her as ""a ferocious mom"". [ 23 ] [ 27 ] Chopra Jonas did a lot of preparations and research before the filming and also met the real-life Aditi. [ 28 ] Bose was opposed to Chopra Jonas meeting Aditi but Chopra Jonas was adamant the meeting must go ahead because Aditi treated the situation differently than her husband and she felt like she needed to have those difficult conversations with Aditi. [ 29 ] According to Chopra Jonas, she was also dependent on Bose and would ask a lot of questions about the character. She learnt a lot from Bose and Aditi, and Bose's interpretation of Aditi. [ 27 ] [ 29 ] Chopra Jonas said, ""I'm not a mother, I needed to understand from both Aditi and Shonali who have both lost their children ... where does that take you? What do you feel in your heart?"" She said Aditi reminded of her of own mother and chose to channel her in Aditi. [ 26 ] Chopra Jonas, who had no children, found the role challenging, saying the ""film was scaring me in every scene"" but felt the role made her experience two aspects of motherhood. [ 25 ]

Akhtar chose to appear in The Sky Is Pink because of the story, which he found ""moving and incredibly inspiring"", and the people involved in the film. Akhtar also relied on Bose's vision of Niren to form his character. [ 30 ] Akhtar was also instructed to not meet the real-life Aditi and Niren before filming; Bose did not want her actors to be influenced by or to imitate the film's subjects. [ 31 ] Akhtar was given filmed interviews of the family for research, and also found that the research material in the form of writing and the footage helped him create his own version of Niren. [ 31 ] Akhtar met Niren while filming; he felt he and Niren had a lot in common. Being a parent, Akhtar found easy to relate to his character; [ 32 ] he said, ""the challenge was not in feeling the kind of parental love I needed to evoke, but imagining what losing a child could potentially feel like"". [ 32 ] The actor said he chose not to over-dramatise his portrayal because ""the real parents never over-dramatised their situation"". Akhtar revealed that Aditi and Niren dealt with the situation in such a normal way that it would seem very abnormal to others and would invite the question of ""How are they happy and smiling all the time?"" [ 32 ] He said, ""They wanted to give their daughter a joyous life ... they didn't want her to be mournful and keep thinking about the end, they just wanted her to be happy as long as she was here ...It's so, so inspiring"". [ 32 ]

Like Chopra and Akhtar, Wasim was and drawn to the story of the film and said she had immediately fallen in love with it. [ 33 ] Wasim said her character touched her heart and that she was honoured to be playing this role. [ 33 ] Saraf described his character Ishaan as someone who becomes the pillar of the family during the tragedy. He said portraying the character was delightful because he could explore human emotions a lot more than he had before in his career. [ 34 ] Unlike the rest of the cast, Saraf was not allowed to see the documented footage of the Chaudhary family because Bose thought he would not be able to take it well. [ 22 ] To prepare for his character, Saraf had researched the Chaudhary family during the audition process. After his casting, he stopped his research and relied mostly on Bose's advice and the collaborative efforts of the cast, which he said enhanced his performance. [ 22 ]

Costume designer Eka Lakhani designed the clothes for the film, [ 5 ] which spans 25 years, during which Aditi's and Niren's looks undergo several changes as they age. These changes were mostly accomplished with make-up and hair styling. [ 35 ] Chopra Jonas's hairstyle informs the age of her character; when her character is young, her hair is long and shortens as she ages in the film; at 50 she has short hair. [ 35 ] Staying true to the real-life Aditi, Chopra Jonas was given a glamorous and make-up-heavy look because Aditi had made an effort to look glamorous and, throughout her 40s, her philosophy was ""when life sucks, look like a million bucks"". [ 25 ] Chopra Jonas had suggested she should put on some weight and colour her hair grey to show her character's aging in the film but Bose declined her request. [ 26 ] Bose thought it would be a cliché to show Aditi as dowdy in the later portions of the film because the real Aditi is very glamorous and likes to dress up, even in difficult times. [ 26 ] When he is young, Akhtar's character Niren has curly hair but as he ages, he is given a moustache in the later portions of the film. [ 35 ]

Principal photography of The Sky Is Pink began on 8 August 2018 in Mumbai with all of its cast members. [ 33 ] The cinematographers were Kartik Vijay and Nick Cooke, and production design was done by Aradhana Seth . [ 5 ] The second schedule of filming began on 13 October 2018 in London . [ 36 ] The London schedule lasted six days and concluded on 19 October 2018. [ 37 ] Filming moved to Delhi as a part of the second schedule on 12 November 2018. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] The scenes were filmed at several locations in Delhi, including Chandani Chowk , which Bose specifically chose to show the culture of the locality on film. [ 17 ] Bose said, ""Delhi has a lot of character and every locality means something. You can capture its beauty in the greenery here, the charm of old Delhi – this mix is very interesting."" [ 17 ] While filming in the locality, a ""sea of people"" gathered to watch Chopra and Akhtar, who were filming their scenes on a terrace. [ 17 ] The second schedule of the film was completed in the last week of November. [ 40 ] Chopra, who was getting married on 1 December 2018, filmed her scenes up until four days before her wedding to Nick Jonas . [ 40 ] The film's producer Siddharth Roy Kapur praised Chopra Jonas for her commitment, saying, ""Priyanka has been wonderful. She will be shooting with us right till the very eve of her nuptials, which I think shows a tremendous amount of professionalism."" [ 40 ] The producers and Bose were accommodating; they created a separate ""wedding approvals room"" for Chopra Jonas so she could discuss her wedding preparations with her team between filming her scenes. [ 41 ] [ better source needed ]

In February 2019, Bose announced the final schedule of filming would occur in March. [ 42 ] The final schedule began in the Andaman Islands on 1 March 2019 and continued until 9 March 2019 when the filming wrapped. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Although the filming was completed, Bose said a song was still to be filmed. [ 44 ] The filming of the song started on 6 June 2019 in Mumbai and lasted five days. [ 45 ] The song ""Pink Gulaabi Sky"" was supposed to feature as part of the plot but Bose felt it did not go with the flow of the story. The song was cut from the final film and was ultimately used for promotional purposes. [ 46 ] Bose complimented the producers for agreeing with her decision to cut the song, saying, ""When we shot the song, I thought that it was a fun number and looked lovely. Later, I was surprised to see that the makers are in sync with my view. Considering the fact that the team had spent a lot of money to shoot the song, it requires guts to take a decision like this"". [ 46 ] The filming was done over ten months. [ 47 ] The film was edited by Manas Mittal. [ 5 ]

The Sky Is Pink 's central theme of death and its acceptance was noted by many critics. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Priyanka Roy of The Telegraph noted the melancholic theme and found its treatment in the film to be completely opposite, writing that the film ""recognises the pain that arises from loss but it never makes loss the centre of what it wants to say"". [ 49 ] Subhash K. Jha said the director's conscious effort to keep the ""going bouncy and bright"" in spite of the looming presence of death could have gone horribly wrong but that ""the war-cry to stay positive"" is implemented with exceeding delicacy. [ 50 ] According to Jha, the audience feel the presence of death underlining every moment of the film and yet the dilemma of mortality is ""never trivialized, glamorized or underplayed"". [ 50 ] Jha felt that Bose's narrative sparkles with a joie de vivre , adding, ""There is an unstoppable gusto woven into the story's somber spirit, like a shot of rum in coke. Bracing and clarity-inducing."" [ 50 ]

Ishita Sengupta of The Indian Express said the film goes beyond the central theme of ""embracing death rather than feeling betrayed by it"", commenting on the restroom scene in which Aditi and Niren talk after their daughter has died and Niren suggests a move to another country as a way to deal with their daughter's death and an astounded Aditi asking what will they do about their daughter's belongings. [ 48 ] She noted Aditi was immersed in grief while Niren had moved on, saying ""it no longer remains preoccupied with the act of letting go but delves into how much to let go of, asks who decides it and—mainly—how to"". [ 48 ] Sengupta said the film closely examines the ""contours of grief"" and the emotions surrounding it. [ 48 ] Sengupta appreciated of the nonlinear narrative , which according to her makes the more sombre moments happier and offsets pathos with love. [ 48 ] Bose, having lost her son, which resulted in end of her marriage, said she wanted to explore the relationship of couples who lose a child and its effects on their lives, often leading to the end of the marriage. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Sengupta noted the director does not let mourning severe the ties between Aditi and Niren, writing, ""It is not acceptance that brings Aditi and Niren together but the shared promise they had extracted in youth to stay with each other come what may. They do not fall back on who they have become but on who they were."" [ 48 ] Sengupta said the characters' reconciliation at the end of the film can be taken as ""wish fulfillment"" of Bose's own marriage or a compromise on reality from aching adversity. [ 48 ] This sentiment was shared by Poulomi Das of Arré , who noted the film serves as both a post-mortem of the filmmaker's own fate and an exercise in second-hand catharsis or wish-fulfillment. [ 51 ]

According to Das, The Sky Is Pink examines the ethos of parenthood, noting the film feels less like a biopic of a dead teenager and more like an unabashed tribute to the parents, writing, ""the afterlife of caregiving that depletes one while nourishing the other"". [ 51 ] She noted Bose had adopted a ""curiously alternative gaze"" to the dying girl template popularized by films such as My Sister's Keeper (2009) and The Fault in Our Stars (2014) to reverse conventions by focusing on the parents rather than the dying girl. [ 51 ] A review published in Mid-Day said the film is about the resilience of parents ""who move heaven and earth for the good of their children"". [ 52 ] The reviewer said, ""the film smartly plays with the structure to dive audience deeper and deeper into the characters and circumstances on screen—rather than simply a plot"", which makes audience emerge from ""an astonishingly personal story navigating through dark spaces with reasonable hope and incredible insight"". [ 52 ]

Sonia Chopra of Sify said, ""If the film's idea is to make you rethink life, it succeeds to a great extent. It also makes you think about choices and how they affect our lives. At one point, the film explores what constitutes a ""right choice"" and whether such a thing exists."" [ 53 ] She noted the humour and emotional pay-offs in the film while praising the director for going deeper while keeping things palatable, and said it makes us think about Hrishikesh Mukherjee 's Anand (1971). [ 53 ] Bose said she told her own philosophy in the film, but she did not aim to teach anyone anything, saying, ""I am simply showing you certain characters with certain relationships and things that happened to them. The fact that they are absolutely real and nothing is made up, may give you food for thought and inspire you a little"". [ 10 ]

Shrishti Negi of News18 noted The Sky Is Pink 's courageous and sobering portrayal of motherhood, calling Aditi a ""ferociously protective mother"" who uses her daughter's impending death to inspire her to live an eventful life. According to Negi, ""Aditi's journey is just as crucial to the film in all its complex, transfixing and wrenching dynamics"". [ 54 ] This sentiment was echoed by Charvi Kathuria of SheThePeople , who wrote, ""The movie is a subtle reminder for us to live our life to the fullest because we really don't know which day becomes our last day. Aditi knew that her daughter won't be alive for very long. She wanted her daughter to enjoy her life to the hilt."" [ 55 ]

Bose said Aditi was a tigress (in terms of her children), who ""came up with a mental bucket list for her daughter and made each moment count of her remaining short life"". [ 9 ] Nishi Trivedi of Bengaluru Central University noted the significance of the ""metaphorical title"", writing the film's message is ""live life on your own terms"", adding, ""The idea that you can paint the sky with the colour you want gives a deeper meaning to the title of the film"". [ 56 ] The film's title comes from a real incident involving Aditi and Ishaan. [ 6 ] [ 10 ] An incident [as shown in the film] where Ishaan is unfairly punished at school for painting his sky pink instead of blue. [ 53 ] Consoling the child, Aditi tells him that everyone has their own sky and they can paint it with whichever colour they like. Sonia Chopra took note of the scene calling it a ""standout"" moment. [ 53 ] Bose told an interviewer: ""I found a beautiful metaphor in this real incident where a mother teaches and encourages her child to think out of the box and not be bound by society's restrictions and preconceived notions"". [ 9 ] [ 10 ]

A review published in HuffPost took note of the colour palette used in the film, saying, ""the dark shadow of death looms large over the film's bubblegum-wrapped, glossy universe"". [ 57 ] According to the reviewer, London's winters look ""ominous"" with the city's red Tube trains and telephone boxes popping out as ""signages of gloom"" in frames composed mostly of depressing greys, writing, ""The frames (and the character wardrobes) light up as the film's mood progresses to become more cheerful, with dramatic reds, purples, and yellows illuminating the screen"". [ 57 ] Jha noted London to be a living character in the film. [ 50 ]

The music soundtrack to The Sky Is Pink was composed by Pritam and the lyrics were written by Gulzar . [ 7 ] It contains four original songs and a reprisal, with vocals performed by Arijit Singh , Antara Mitra , Arjun Kanungo , Lisa Mishra , Shashwat Singh, Jonita Gandhi and Sreerama Chandra. [ 58 ] The soundtrack album was released on 7 October 2019 by Zee Music Company . [ 58 ] Though not a part of the main soundtrack, the film's closing credits include a song titled ""For Aisha"" that was composed by Aisha Chaudhary's brother Ishaan under his band name ""Memba"". The song is sung by the Nooran Sisters , Naomi Wild and Evan Giia . [ 59 ] Anvita Dutt wrote the song with Memba, Wild and Giia. [ 60 ]

The Sky Is Pink was one of the most anticipated Indian films of 2019. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Roy Kapur had hoped for the film to be released in the first half of 2019 but in February 2019, it was announced the film would be released on 11 October 2019. [ 33 ] [ 63 ] The first look of the film was released on 23 July 2019. [ 62 ] Several exclusive stills from the film were released on 8 September 2019. [ 64 ] The first poster was released on 9 September 2019 and Chopra Jonas tweeted that the official trailer would be released the next day. [ 65 ] Firstpost commented that the ""aesthetically pleasing poster"" looked ""fun-filled and refreshing."" [ 66 ] The film's trailer was released on 10 September 2019. [ 67 ] HuffPost said the film looked like a ""winner"" while The New Indian Express called the trailer ""heart warming"", noting it ""promises to be a love story high on emotional quotient with an equal amount of humour"". [ 68 ] [ 69 ]

In July 2019, media reported The Sky Is Pink had been selected to premiere at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival . [ 70 ] The only Asian film to be selected for ""Gala Presentation"", The Sky Is Pink premiered at the festival at the Roy Thomson Hall on 13 September 2019 and received a 15-minute standing ovation. [ 71 ] The premiere was attended by 2,000 people and tickets sold out. The Chaudhary family were in the attendance at the premiere along with the cast, director and the producers. [ 72 ] The premiere was followed by another sold-out screening at the Elgin Theatre . [ 71 ] The film also premiered at the 24th Busan International Film Festival and the 2019 BFI London Film Festival . [ 73 ]

The promotion of the film started in the last week of September 2019. [ 74 ] Chopra Jonas, Akhtar, Saraf and Bose took part in the promotion of the film [ 75 ] but Wasim, who by the time of its release had retired from acting due to her religious beliefs, did not. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] After promoting the film in India, Chopra Jonas promoted it in the United States by appearing on American prime time talk show The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon [ 78 ] and the daytime talk show The View . [ citation needed ] The Sky Is Pink became the first Hindi film to be promoted on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon . [ 78 ]

[ 79 ] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare rated the film four stars out of five, lauding its ability to make viewers laugh despite its tragic undertone. He concluded, ""this bitter-sweet film will make you laugh, will make you cry and will surely make you ruminate on the glorious uncertainty of life"". [ 83 ] Writing for Mid-Day , film critic Mayank Shekhar rated The Sky Is Pink three and a half stars out of five, praising Bose for telling an ""astonishingly dark personal story with reasonable hope"" that never felt exploitative or manipulative. He complemented the ""smart"" screenplay, which he felt was structured to dive viewers ""deeper and deeper"" into the characters and circumstances on screen. [ 52 ] In a three and a half stars out of five review, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com declared Chopra Jonas's ""fiery performance"" to be the film's highlight while also praising the performances of Akhtar, Wasim and Saraf. [ 84 ]

Ankur Pathak of HuffPost called the film a ""soul-stirring portrait of love, life and death"" that is ""cinematic equivalent of visiting a therapist"". He singled out Chopra Jonas' ""extraordinary"" performance which he thought was ""hard to look away from"" while also noting Akhtar's ""measured performance"" and Wasim's ""fantastic"" turn. [ 57 ] Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gave the film three and a half stars out of five, calling it ""a stirring watch"" and noting the film scores high on the emotional quotient and the performances of its principal cast. [ 85 ] Writing for NDTV , Saibal Chatterjee rated the film three and a half stars out of five, praised Bose for her direction and writing, and added it had been ""enhanced appreciably by the presence of Chopra"". [ 86 ]

Writing for Firstpost , Anna M. M. Vetticad said The Sky Is Pink is a ""moving, uncommonly calm take on grief"" which is ""funny, believable and heart-wrenching all rolled into one"". She praised Chopra Jonas for her ""remarkably controlled performance"", Akhtar for a solid turn and for matching Chopra Jonas's ""simmering restraint"", Wasim for her ""cheeriness"" and for not going ""over the top"", and Saraf's ""matured performance"". [ 87 ] Teo Bugbee of The New York Times lauded Bose for achieving a balanced tone in the film, writing, ""The writer and director Shonali Bose bounces from tone to tone, livening the somber subject matter with bright hues, quippy dialogue and an ever-jubilant score"". Bugbee also highlighted the appeal of the performances, particularly that of Chopra Jonas. [ 88 ] Samira Sood of ThePrint said the film is ""an emotionally wrenching yet bitingly funny exploration of family and death"". [ 89 ] Vinayak Chakraborty of Outlook rated the film three stars out of five, criticising the ""flashback-driven storyline"" and its runtime, which he felt was too long at nearly two and half hours. He said, however, the film still works with all of its flaws. [ 90 ] Anupama Chopra of Film Companion found the film to be ""sensitive"" but highly ""sanitised"". She wrote "" The Sky is Pink is sincere and heartfelt but it never gets raw or messy"". [ 91 ] Rajeev Masand criticised the film's ""blatant manipulation"" but added, ""there are moments that left me with a heavy heart"". [ 92 ] Both Anupama Chopra and Masand considered Akhtar's performance to be more effective than that of the other cast members while also praising the performances of Chopra Jonas and Wasim. [ 91 ] [ 92 ]

Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated The Sky Is Pink with two stars out of five, and said the film only occasionally works and that it feels ""both constructed and sentimental"", writing, ""With the material at hand, you expect a legitimate heart-breaker but this one left me mostly unmoved"". [ 93 ] Cath Clarke of The Guardian dismissed the film as ""way too saccharine"" and said there are only ""occasional moments ... that shine with truth"". [ 94 ] Dennis Harvey of Variety disliked The Sky Is Pink and wrote that the ""somewhat bland polish on all levels doesn't much assist the raw pain that should be at this story's center"". [ 95 ] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in also disliked the film, writing that the ""attempt to be insouciant about death produces no emotional pay-offs"". Ramnath found Wasim and Saraf to be ""lovely""; Chopra Jonas to be ""more affecting than Akhtar"" but said Chopra Jonas' ""perfectly made-up face and fashion-forwardness are huge distractions"". [ 96 ]

Being an ""offbeat and niche"" film targeting a mature audience in big cities, commercial expectations from The Sky Is Pink were low. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] In an interview with Hindustan Times , trade analyst Girish Johar noted the business of the film largely relied on word of mouth , saying, ""It is an upmarket film, a human drama for limited audience. It will release only in big cities and metros."" [ 98 ] The film collected ₹ 2.50 crore on the opening day and revenue was expected to grow the next day. [ 99 ] The film showed 60% of growth on its second day and earned ₹ 4 crore. [ 100 ] Revenue remained static on its third day, collecting ₹ 4 crore for an opening weekend collection of ₹ 10.70 crore at the domestic box office. [ 101 ]

The Sky Is Pink faced strong competition from the Bollywood action thriller War and the comic book film Joker , both of which were doing business exceeding the expectations of the trade. [ 97 ] [ 102 ] The Sky Is Pink dropped over 40% on its first Monday, collecting ₹ 1.30 crore on its fourth day and earning ₹ 15.40 crore in its first week. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] The film collected ₹ 4.50 crore in its second week, and collections stood at approximately ₹ 20 crore after two weeks. [ 105 ] It did not perform well at the box office. [ 106 ] Trade Analyst Joginder Tuteja summarised the reason for the film's disappointing commercial performance, which he thought ""deserved better"", in an article published on Moneycontrol.com , blaming the ""poor marketing"" that ""didn't really convey clearly what the film was all about"", in addition to strong competition from other films. [ 106 ] He also said the film's English title was its biggest problem because it was too literary and made it sound like an American and European art film . [ 106 ] According to Bollywood Hungama , The Sky Is Pink grossed ₹ 23.85 crore in India and ₹ 10.56 crore overseas for a worldwide gross revenue of ₹ 344.1 million.

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!,tt1891884,"The film begins where its predecessor ended , with reigning don Shoaib Khan earning respect after his mentor, Sultan Mirza handed over his power to Shoaib in 1975, only to be assassinated by him as revenge for a public humiliation immediately after.

Twelve years later, in 1987, Khan is still a charismatic, suave womaniser, who has extended his empire to the Middle East. His only friends are Javed (who oversees his illegal work), his former love Mumtaz, and Aslam, a teenager Khan met during a visit to the slums in which he grew up.

An older Khan returns to Bombay to kill Rawal, who opposed his ambition to take the reins in Bombay. Although the city was his first love, rising starlet Jasmine wins his heart. Khan advances Jasmine's career by rigging awards, and showers her with gifts; he becomes obsessed with her. He sends Aslam and another trustworthy aide, Jimmy, to kill Rawal. Jimmy fails, accidentally killing his girlfriend, Mona, and flees. He is soon captured by the police, hot on Khan's trail after learning about his arrival in Bombay. Jimmy, loyal to Khan, does not crack during his interrogation and is freed due to lack of evidence. The police intend to draw Khan out from hiding; he has eluded them for twelve years, and this is their last chance to take him on Indian soil.

Khan, suspicious that Jimmy has become a police informer, decides to kill him but Aslam offers to do the deed to deflect police attention. He, Dedh Tang and several thugs masquerade as rival biker gangs and stage a brawl. Plain-clothes police officers try to control the chaos when Aslam corners Jimmy. When a police officer stops Aslam, Khan appears out of nowhere, murders Jimmy and injures the policeman. A chase ensues; the police fail to catch the two, who escape in Khan's Mercedes.

Although Khan has bought Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, saying that she has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys the set of the film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour deadline to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.

Aslam arrives at the address Khan has given him and, much to his shock, sees Jasmine walking towards his car. Initially angry that he is still following her, the two realise that they have been caught up in a complicated affair – that Aslam, unbeknownst to Jasmine, works for Khan, and that Jasmine was the one he had been sent to pick up. Before either can speak, a car containing Rawal and his henchmen arrives at a distance. Rawal shoots Jasmine, having learned of her relationship with Khan and hoping that hurting her lure the gangster into a vulnerable position.

Jasmine remains unconscious at the hospital as Khan arrives. He accuses Aslam of being in love with his fiancée – an accusation which Aslam denies as Khan reveals in an attempt to pacify Aslam that he has masterminded a plan to murder Rawal and ensure his own dominance over the Mumbai underworld. Khan intends to fabricate a story of him feuding with Aslam to tempt Rawal and his rivals into contacting Aslam. The ""news"" reaches Rawal, who seems delighted at the prospect of being able to turn Khan's right-hand man against him.

When Rawal calls Aslam at the hospital, Aslam, now fully aware of Khan's feelings towards Jasmine, seems unsure whether to abide by Khan's plan. He reluctantly provides Rawal with an address, ending the phone call by telling him to ""murder the bastard"". Khan, lying in wait outside the address with a sniper rifle, kills Rawal and his henchmen when they arrive. Khan, having consolidated power, savours his victory and walks into a police station undeterred as a taunt to law enforcement. However, Dedh Tang accidentally reveals Aslam's feelings for Jasmine in the midst of celebration. Khan, infuriated, diverts the car to the hospital to confront Aslam, who has continued to stay with Jasmine as she recovers from being shot by Rawal. Knowing that his friend is in danger, Dedh Tang honks the horn of the car repeatedly after Shoaib and his henchmen enter the building, alerting Aslam to the danger and giving him time to escape. Entering to see an empty bed where Jasmine had before been laying, Khan realises that Dedh Tang had given him away.

Khan sends his aide Akbar to kill Aslam after he and Jasmine flee to Aslam's uncle's restaurant in Dongri . Aslam assures Jasmine that Khan, though violent, would never hurt him. Their conversation is interrupted by a car's horn honking – running outside, Aslam is ambushed by Akbar after discovering the body of Dedh Tang, who has been killed by Shoaib for aiding the couple in their escape. Aslam, though injured and initially losing the fight, kills Akbar with a shovel. He calls Khan to tell him that the murder of Dedh Tang has, in effect, erased his deep-seated loyalty to his former boss. Khan responds by telling Aslam that sending Akbar was a mistake, as he must be the one to kill the man he views as also having betrayed him by ""stealing"" Jasmine.

Aslam and Khan confront one another as the police, having been alerted to Khan's location by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri . Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend himself in front of Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Sawant appears through the gathered crowd – even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Sawant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognise the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by Javed. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.

In the last scene, a bullet-ridden, dejected Khan reads a letter in Urdu he was unable to give Jasmine in the cargo hold of a ship leaving the city forever.

Tanuj Garg, CEO of Balaji Motion Pictures, announced on Twitter that principal photography began on 27 August 2012 in Mumbai. [ 9 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Female lead Sonakshi Sinha joined the cast and crew two days later after completing her previous film, Son of Sardaar , with Ajay Devgn . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The overseas shooting schedule began in September in Oman , [ 13 ] the first major Indian production filmed in the sultanate. Portions of the film were shot on a beach in Qantab , on the corniche in Qurum , and at the Shangri-La's Barr Al Jissah Resort & Spa in Muscat . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] When director Milan Luthria became ill with a virus, shooting was postponed for three days. To make up the lost time Luthria persuaded Kumar to work on two consecutive Sundays, the first time he had worked on a Sunday since Priyadarshan 's 2006 Bhagam Bhag . [ 17 ] The remainder of the film was shot on location in Khala, on the Sassoon Docks and at Mukesh Mills in Mumbai. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The shoot was wrapped up by January 2013. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]

The film's visual effects (VFX) were by Reliance MediaWorks , which also produced computer-generated imagery (CGI) for Balaji Motion Pictures and Luthria for its prequel, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai ( 2010 ). [ 20 ] Since the company was also generating VFX for the yet-unreleased Chennai Express ( 2013 ) its roster of animators and compositors was divided into two teams. The Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! team consisted of 40 artists, who augmented 600 digital shots in one month. [ 20 ] Luthria informed the company that Dobaara! was set during the 1980s, with car chases requiring visual effects. About 25 percent were shot against chroma key backgrounds, since they would have been difficult to film otherwise. [ 21 ] Scenes in the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the United Arab Emirates were recreated three-dimensionally with polygonal modelling in Autodesk Maya instead of the live-action plates used for shots in Muscat. [ 22 ] Adobe Photoshop and ZBrush were used to add texture to matte paintings in the background and the 3D models . [ 22 ] Outdoor shots in Mumbai (such as Colaba Causeway and Ballard Pier) were replaced by interior and exterior live-action plates from Oman. [ 22 ] According to Sanjiv Naik, the film's VFX supervisor, the last few scenes were the most difficult ones to shoot. In the last scene where Khan is lying wounded in the cargo hold of a ship, the camera zooms out to reveal the word Mumbai . [ 23 ] The VFX shot was captured in 2,000 frames which took 15 days to complete, with the camera panning out only 30 feet in reality. [ 23 ] Except for the interior shot of Kumar, the remaining shots were digital. [ 23 ] The live action was filmed with RED and Arri 's Alexa digital motion-picture camera . [ 21 ]

Emraan Hashmi , who appeared in the original film, was initially chosen to play the lead role. However, Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar for the role of Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim ). In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor , but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. [ 24 ] Many actresses were considered for the female lead, including Ileana D'Cruz , Kareena Kapoor , Kangana Ranaut , Asin , Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone , but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. [ 25 ] Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS . She did not charge her fees for the film as Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her mother-in-law for the past 40 years, and also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala Hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. [ 32 ] Khan in preparation for his role in the film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor , copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. Back in those days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]

Akshay Kumar played a fictitious gangster based on Dawood Ibrahim. Kumar's character's look was revealed on a reality show on Aapka Colors. Kumar's entrance on the show was supposed to be accompanied by music after a scene from the prequel (choreographed by director Milan Luthria), followed by an action sequence. [ 38 ] The scene had a ""minor glitch"", believed to be a failed attempt to sabotage Kumar's entrance. [ 38 ] The scene was performed twice, taking a toll on Kumar's back and leading to the cancellation of a public appearance. [ 38 ] The film would reportedly feature a scene with Kumar watching a cricket match, [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] but whether the match was between India and Pakistan at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium during the 1980s was unconfirmed. [ 43 ] The first trailer premiered in Mumbai on 27 May 2013, where many of the film's outdoor scenes were shot. [ 44 ] To promote the film, Kumar flew from New York (where he was on holiday with his family) to Birmingham to watch the India-Pakistan ICC Champions Trophy match on 15 June 2013 at Edgbaston Cricket Ground. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] A second trailer of the film was released on 1 July 2013, with narration by Kumar's character (Shoaib Khan), revealing plot details such as the rivalry between Kumar's and Imran Khan's characters for Jasmine's love. The trailer described Khan as the film's antihero , featuring action sequences between Shoaib Khan and Aslam ( Imran Khan ). Mohar Basu of Koimoi praised the second trailer, its background score, direction and action choreography, saying it ""is even better than the film's first trailer"" and has ""an explosive impact on its audiences"". [ 47 ]

Producer Ekta Kapoor promoted the film's second trailer on 5 July 2013, buying prime-time (8 to 11 pm) slots on four television channels. [ 48 ] She also spent 20 million rupees for a slot on a leading channel for a promotion for the film. [ 49 ] Akshay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha and Imran Khan (the three leads) promoted the film on Comedy Nights with Kapil , hosted by Kapil Sharma . The show was telecasted on 3 August 2013. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Kumar, Sinha, Khan, Kapoor and most of the other cast and crew visited the Dargah Sharif (a shrine to the Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer ) on Monday morning, 5 August, to pray for the film's success and the well-being of all involved. [ 54 ]

Hollywood actor Al Pacino enjoyed the film's promotion, saying that the promos and posters reminded him of The Godfather when business associate Barry Navidi showed him the theatrical trailer (Pacino portrayed Michael Corleone , son of Vito Corleone ). [ 55 ] Akshay Kumar said of Pacino's response: ""A touch of appreciation is always held dearly in an actor's arms, even if it's from the simplest of people like our beloved spot boys. But to have your work spoken of so kindly by the world's most admired gangster Al Pacino himself – I had goose-bumps thinking about him watching the promo! I was so humbled, not only as an actor but as a fan of his legendary work. I pray he enjoys the final piece as much as he enjoyed the promo!"" [ 55 ] Actor Rishi Kapoor , on whom the original version of the song Tayyab Ali was picturised in Amar Akbar Anthony , praised Imran Khan's performance and the song after an impromptu meeting with Khan (who was concerned about comparisons between the versions) during a dubbing session for the film. [ 56 ]

The film's title has been changed several times. The media first referred to the production as Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai 2 , although it was earlier officially known as Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Again . [ 57 ] Due to the producer's beliefs in astrology and numerology , the film was renamed Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobara [ 57 ] (""again"" in Hindi). A ""y"" and an extra ""a"" were added, making it Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! . [ 58 ] [ 59 ]

It was promoted at the unveiling of a line of LED televisions by manufacturer Arise India with appearances by Kumar, Sinha, Khan and Kapoor. [ 60 ] In addition to visiting the Dargah Sharif and the Balaji shrine in South India to pray for the success of her films before their release, Kapoor fasted during Ramazan for the film's success and planned visits to Mumbai's Mohamed Ali Road to celebrate iftaari and feed the poor. [ 61 ] Chennai Express and Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! were originally not scheduled for release by Pakistani distributors and exhibitors, but deals were finalised to release both films in Pakistan. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] In an effort to discourage cinema audience from using Mobile phones at theatres with the help of a short-film featuring Kumar in his character, Shoaib Khan from the film. The short directed by Luthria was shown in PVR Cinemas from 31 May 2013 till the film's theatrical release. [ 64 ] The film was available on Netflix . [ 65 ]

The soundtrack of Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! features five songs, with three of them were composed by Pritam , and two of them by Anupam Amod . The latter also recreated the song ""Tayyab Ali"" which is originally composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal and written by Anand Bakshi , from the 1977 film Amar Akbar Anthony . The lyrics for all the songs were penned by Rajat Arora , including the recreated version of ""Tayyab Ali"". The first single ""Ye Tune Kya Kiya"", sung by Javed Bashir and composed by Pritam , was released on 13 June 2013, [ 66 ] as the lead single from the soundtrack album. The full soundtrack album was released by T-Series on 17 July 2013, with all tracks available for digital download as singles on the digital music platform iTunes . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ]

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! 's teaser trailer was released along with Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani , which released on 31 May 2013. [ 72 ]

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! was initially scheduled to be released on Eid, 8 August 2013 [ 57 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] was pushed back to 15 August 2013, to avoid clashing with Rohit Shetty 's directorial venture, Chennai Express starring Shah Rukh Khan . [ 57 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] The decision was made by Jitendra on Shah Rukh Khan's request after a meeting was held between the producers of the respective films so as to provide both each of the films ample opportunity of earning-well at the box office without diminishing each other's profits. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ]

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! was released on 1,300–1,600 screens for India's 67th Independence Day , and some cinemas were sold out. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The screen count increased on 16 August to 2,500–2,700 nationwide. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! received mixed-to-negative reviews. [ 84 ] Anupama Chopra gave the film three out of five stars in The Hindustan Times : ""Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbaai Dobaara! had me cheering for the bad guy. Which, at least in the movies, is never a bad thing. The film gets one extra star for Akshay Kumar, who makes a stellar killer"". [ 85 ] Madhureeta Mukherjee awarded the film 3.5 out of five stars in The Times of India , telling readers to watch the film only for its flattering dons and their heroines, saying ""there's nothing criminal about it!"" [ 86 ] She praised Milan Luthria for capturing the essence of the film's setting and Kumar's portrayal of Shoaib Khan: "" Bhai act with flamboyance and mojo ... He gets a chance to do what he does best – herogiri (albeit less menacing, more entertaining), with charisma and clap-trap dialoguebaazi"" [ 86 ] but criticised Imran Khan's ""ill-at-ease"" rogue, [ 86 ] the second half of the film for being ""at times too overbearing"" [ 86 ] and said, ""this film has its moments, but it's not as compelling as the prequel."" [ 86 ] Vinayak Chakrovorty gave the film two-and-a-half out of five stars in India Today : ""OUATIMD should remind Bollywood what we all always knew: Never make a sequel just for the heck of it if you don't have a genuine idea to entertain"". [ 87 ] Subhash K. Jha termed the film as ""one of the most ill-timed gangster dramas"" criticising the acting of all the three leads, praising only the short cameo of Sonali Bendre. [ 88 ]

The film drew a number of negative reactions from the film critics. Subhra Gupta gave the film a half-star out of five in The Indian Express , saying ""After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that you wonder if there's any juice left in this style of the retro gangsta flick. Or are we heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?"" [ 89 ] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 out of five stars, describing the film as the ""equivalent of getting a root canal"". He criticised the naivety of the three leads: Kumar for his ""in-your-face flamboyance"", Khan for playing an ""urban rich kid slumming it out at a dress-up party"" [ 90 ] and both for ""rat-a-tat punch lines"", [ 90 ] but praised Sonali Bendre 's cameo as Mumtaz. [ 90 ] Mohar Basu gave the film two out of five stars in Koimoi, criticising the melodrama and the ""lacklustre chemistry"", remarking that the film ""lacks the effervescence and naturalness of its prequel"". [ 91 ]

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! and its predecessor Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai have been described as having a storyline and characters similar to the life of Dawood Ibrahim .

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! opened well, with sold-out showings (particularly in Delhi, Mumbai, Punjab , Uttar Pradesh and Hyderabad ) due to its release on Independence Day eve. [ 95 ] Due to limited screen availability (about 1,000), Balaji Motion Pictures negotiated with the producers of Chennai Express to release 1,000 more screens for a total of 2,700.

Kaun Kitne Paani Mein,tt3477214,"Kaun Kitney Paani Mein is a story about two fictitious villages: Upri, which is made up of upper-caste people who are extremely lazy and lack any productive skills, and Bairi, which is made up of lower-caste people who have been involved in labour work and hence have gained a lot of skills. The people of Upri and Bairi are at loggerheads with each other, as generations ago there was a murder-suicide due to caste issues by the then Maharaja ruling the then rich and upper-class Upri village.

As time went by, Upri has seen water shortage due to their lack of skills and Bairi has instead become prosperous. Maharaj Braj Singhdeo ( Saurabh Shukla ), the leader of Upri, survives on his reputation and is almost bankrupt now and doesn't even have money to send his son Raj Singhdeo ( Kunal Kapoor ) to college. On the other hand, Kharu Pahelwan ( Gulshan Grover ) is a prosperous MLA candidate from Bairi village whose daughter Paro ( Radhika Apte ) supports him intellectually and morally. Raj convinces his father Braj to plan and get resources from Bairi village by molesting or marrying Paro and to execute this plan Braj pretends to throw Raj out of his household. Raj goes on to live with Kharu as his assistant and slowly gets into the good books of Amrita Devi ( Hema Singh ), the president of the ruling party who Kharu represents. Raj also falls in love with Paro.

Braj Singhdeo plans an elaborate fraud with the assistance of Amrita Devi, Raj, a tailor who has dug a canal underground to suck water from Bairi and the temple priest to make believe goddess has intervened to get the villages to be united and that Raj and Paro should be married. The villages end up living peacefully together and Raj gets political mileage and becomes an important leader in Amrita's party.

The soundtrack of Kaun Kitney Paani Mein consists of 3 songs composed by Krishna Beura, Bishakh Jyoti - Kanish , Style Bhai and Subhi while the lyrics have been written by Protiqe Mojoomdar and Subhi. [ 7 ]

Kaun Kitney Paani Mein received a mixed response from the critics. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times praised the movie saying, ""This Radhika Apte, Kunal Kapoor starrer takes a strong stand against the barriers of caste and class. The director’s commitment to social values is clearly visible in the film and he deserves praise for his efforts"" and gave it a rating of 3 stars out of 5. [ 8 ] Gayatri Gauri of First Post praised the subject and the performances of its actors Saurabh Shukla and Radhika Apte but was critical of the director Nila Madhab Panda saying, ""With Kaun Kitney Paani Mein, he has an excellent premise. He’s chosen to tell his story as a satire, which makes the film entertaining in parts, but he struggles to make it look and feel credible. Yet despite its pitfalls, Kaun Kitney Paani Mein has moments of fun and a subject that is relevant."" [ 9 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV applauded the performances and the director for selecting a unique concept saying, ""Soil re-mineralisation? That is unprecedented for a Hindi film. Kaun Kitney Paani Mein goes where Hindi cinema rarely ever does. For that alone it deserves to be seen"" and gave the film a rating of 3 stars out of 5. [ 10 ]

Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express appreciated the performance of Saurabh Shukla and the idea selected for the film but criticized the director for the poor execution of a good idea saying, ""Good idea, faulty execution. Using water as a trade commodity is a powerful concept, especially given that there is so much drought and so little accessible clean drinking water in so many parts of India."" and gave the film a rating of 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 stars out of 5. [ 11 ] Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India applauded the narration, acting performances and humour of the film but found the film to be too inconsistent. She gave the film a rating of 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 stars out of 5 and said, ""In the present-day situation, where water is one of the most precious resources, Kaun Kitney Paani Mein touches upon a relevant issue but wraps it all too conveniently, without being confrontational.""

Manjunath (film),tt3056632,"In the hinterland of Uttar Pradesh 27-year-old Manjunath Shanmugam is a student at the state-of-the-art campus of the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM-L). After graduating, Manjunath joins a petroleum company as a sales officer. He is posted in Lakhimpur Kheri, a remote district in rural Uttar Pradesh. One day Manjunath goes missing.

His friends panic, because they know that of late he had been very disturbed and was behaving strangely. He had become serious and scared. He was different from the Manjunath they knew in college, who was always jovial, fun-loving, friendly, and a great entertainer.

One of his friends finds him, but Manjunath is frantic. They send him back to his hometown. Manjunath's parents try to convince him to leave his job at Bharat Oil that is causing him stress. Initially he seems willing but slowly he realises that he doesn't want to be a quitter. (Manjunath believes that, being from a top institute in the country, he has been given an opportunity. As the eldest son of a mineworker, he has had a humble upbringing.)

He realises that the kerosene, mixed with diesel, is coming from ration shops — 'it's the poor people's kerosene'. In addition, he becomes conscious of the extent of pollution caused by burning adulterated fuel. He finds strength and comes back to fight, against his parents wishes.

There is a clear threat to his life, because he insists on doing his duty to stop petrol adulteration. This time, Manjunath is not deterred. He continues doing what he considers right, without worrying about the consequences. As a result, one night he gets brutally killed by the people who are harmed by him doing his duty. His family and friends suffer over his death. They wonder why he put himself in so much danger.

Slowly, the worst fears start coming true. Beyond the initial grief, no one wants to come forward to carry on the fight.

In the film, Manjunath is shown watching what happens after he dies. He is starting to feel that it is all pointless. He cannot watch his parents' tears any more: What was their fault? Maybe he should have compromised. But how can people not see what he has? What he fought was something very big and very important.

Suddenly, people who have no connection to him realise the importance of what Manjunath did and start trying to do something. Like novices, they search their way around: Their will is strong. They start getting help again from unexpected quarters. It is nerve-wracking, with dangers for everyone. Then, instead of one or two, there are a lot of people helping. Manjunath, who has lost hope, realises that it's not all going to waste.

He hopes and prays that they succeed.

The film cuts back and forth from a rock concert. The conflict of the story is not whether Manjunath lived or died, but if the effect of Manjunath lives or dies, and in the end that's the victory.

In an interview with Firstpost, director Sandeep A. Varma stated,

The film was supported by the Manjunath Shanmugam Trust [ 6 ] through which the support of IIM-Lucknow and Manjunath's parents were enlisted. [ 7 ]

Manjunath was primarily shot in Lucknow and areas around, including at the IIM. The rest of the portions were filmed in Mumbai and Bangalore. The filming in U.P. was done under a pseudo-name of being a romantic movie, to avoid the attention of the local people and media. Sandeep and his crew had a close shave with a few corrupt petrol pump owners whilst shooting which forced him to choose the cover story. “Unlike the collective memory of the rest of the country, Manjunath’s story is still alive in Uttar Pradesh. We didn’t want to put the 100-crew unit at risk,” said director Sandeep A. Varma, in an interview with The Indian Express . [ 8 ]

The soundtrack is composed by Sonam Sherpa, Nitin Malik and Subir Malik of Delhi-based rock band Parikrama . The film has four original songs with lyrics penned by Rajneesh Bisht and Sandeep A. Varma. The track ""Shlokas"" is the first rock rendition of the Bhagavad Gita in Bollywood. [ 9 ]

Manjunath was released in India on 9 May 2014. [ 10 ]

Critic Taran Adarsh gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and states that, "" Manjunath is a film that is realistic, brave and powerful. [ 11 ] Critic Subhash K. Jha also gave 3.5 stars out of 5 saying, ""The director pieces together Manjunath's story like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane . [ 12 ] For The Times of India , Renuka Vyavahare wrote, ""One of the least promoted films of the week, Manjunath pleasantly surprises you with its thought-provoking, hard-hitting content and earnest execution. What also set the film apart are its heart-rending parent-child moments and heartfelt performances. Renowned artistes Seema Biswas (as Manju's mother) and Kishor Kadam (Manju's father) deserve awards for their tear-evoking acts."" She gave the film 3 stars out of 5. [ 13 ] Rajeev Masand for IBN Live gave it a rating of 3/5, calling it ""An important story that deserves to be heard."" [ 14 ] Sify.com gave it 3.5 out of 5 saying, ""Don't miss this rare gem. Varma is an astute storyteller, also showcasing a flair for cinematic style. The atmospherics are delightful, and so are the nuances (right from Manjunath's nerdy dressing sense to his worn-out steering wheel cover). Music by Parikrama is superb, even if too much at times."" [ 15 ]

Rahul Desai for Mumbai Mirror wrote, ""The sign of a good biopic, like a documentary, is its current relevance and ability to transcend flaws, as well as the first emotion it elicits from viewers. I felt wronged, and grew stronger as things progressed, only to be shaken by the truth of how relatable Manjunath's psychological struggle was. The tragic part is that Manjunath wasn't a hero; he only had his eyes open in an unrelenting world."" He gave it 3 stars out of 5. [ 16 ] Paloma Sharma for Rediff.com gave it 3 stars out of 5 and said, ""Several scenes even take place from beyond the grave and this turn of events ruins the fast-paced, crisply edited aspect of the film and hence, the early promise it showed. That said though, Manjunath is a brave film, like the man it is based on, as it openly takes on the issue of caste and class – an everyday discrimination that the protagonist faced."" [ 17 ]

In an open letter to DNA, Manjunath's brother S. Raghavendran, as a response to the film's low box office response, wrote,

Manjunath had its world television premiere on 19 November 2014 (Manjunath's death anniversary) on &Pictures (Zee Group). [ 19 ]

To create awareness, &Pictures organised on-ground events at notable colleges as such IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Indore, IIM Lucknow and St. Andrew's College, Mumbai, where a panel discussion was held on the topic “Are heroes like Manjunath ‘brave’ or ‘stupid’ in doing what they do?” The panelists included the film's director Sandeep A. Varma; Raghavendran Shanmugam (Manjunath's brother); cast members from the movie like Sasho Satiiysh, Yashpal Sharma and Rajesh Khattar; notable government officials and IPS officers; and faculty members from the institutes. The events were covered by mainline and regional press. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Manjunath_Movie_Poster.jpeg/220px-Manjunath_Movie_Poster.jpeg
Amavas,tt8396186,"The story is about Karan who is possessed by the spirit of his friend Sameer, who gets murdered. After that, Maya also gets murdered by Sameer's spirit which is in the body of Karan. Sameer's spirit also kills Gotti, Shibani, Ruhi (Maya's sister) and also tries to kill Ahana. But Karan saves her by killing himself in the burning grave of Sameer. Karan has an injury mark on his chest given by Sameer during his death, his (spirit) only source to survive in the body of Karan. But in the end scene, it seems that there was also same kind of injury mark in the hand of Ahana. So the spirit then also exists in Ahana with the mark of the ghost Movie ends promising a sequel.

The film's soundtrack was composed by Sanjeev–Darshan , Ankit Tiwari , Abhijit Vaghani and Asad Khan , with lyrics written by Sandeep Nath , Junaid Wasi , Anurag Bhomia, Kunaal Verma and Ikka. The first song was titled ""Jab Se Mera Dil"" and released on 11 December 2018. The album is presented by T-Series . [ 4 ]

On 5 January 2019, a new poster was unveiled, which revealed that the release date was postponed to 8 February that year. [ 1 ] [ 5 ]

Amavas received mixed reviews from critics. Reza Noorani of The Times of India rates the film one and half stars out of five and writes, ""As far as the horror is concerned, there is nothing to worry about because the ghost is extremely predictable even when it tries to surprise you. While the effects are slick and the ghosts match up to international standards, they cannot save this film from turning into a painful two-hour-long watch"". [ 6 ] In contrast, Subhash K. Jha of News18 gave it three stars out of five and opined: ""Death is indeed a ""grave"" matter in Hindi horror, what with the graveyard being a favourite haunt of horror. Amavas doesn't visit any graveyard but a grave plays an important part in the rites of exorcism. The film presses all the right buttons, ticks all the boxes"". [ 7 ] Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror , however, rated the film one star out of five, and felt it ""reduces horror to hilarity"". [ 8 ]

The film earned ₹ 0.75 crore nett in India on its opening day. Amavas has collected ₹ 30 million nett pan India in its opening week. [ 3 ]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Amavas_official_poster.jpg/220px-Amavas_official_poster.jpg
Gabbar Is Back,tt2424988,"The police get information that 10 tehsildars across Maharashtra have been mysteriously kidnapped. However, no sooner are they mysteriously returned – except the most corrupt officer, who is hanged . The police get a CD from mystery man 'Gabbar', who says his mission is to target corrupt officers. Police driver Sadhuram is convinced he can crack the mystery of who is Gabbar.

National College professor Aditya thrashes some goons who try to vandalize college property. On his way home one night, he encounters a young lawyer, Shruti, who is in a hurry to take a pregnant woman to the hospital. Some days later, she bumps into Aditya again during a fight, and they begin dating. Sadhuram in the meantime finds out there's one honest officer in each department across the state, and is convinced that each of these honest officers has a link to Gabbar.

One fateful day, Aditya and Shruti are checking out of a roadside café when Shruti is hurt in a minor accident, and Aditya takes her to the Patil Hospital where a female doctor insists on taking a number of expensive tests. Aditya happens to overhear a doctor try to suggest the rather expensive Caesarean section delivery and is soon convinced of the hospital staff's dirty tricks when he notices a father-daughter duo being informed of the mother's death only after an expensive bill was paid. He deliberately checks in a poor woman's dead husband as a patient; unaware of his trap, the hospital tries to swindle money out of Aditya by pretending to treat the already dead man, making him pay heavily for tests and medicines. However, Aditya shows them the death certificate as a proof of their knowingly admitting a dead man. The young owner of the hospital, Vikas Patil, is furious when Aditya releases the video of the hospital's corruption to the media despite having struck a deal with him. Vikas is murdered by the enraged public, and his father Digvijay Patil sees Aditya in the hospital CCTV footage, only to realize this is the same man he had supposedly killed five years ago.

A flashback soon reveals that Aditya's pregnant wife Sunaina died when the buildings in their colony collapsed and killed hundreds of other people too. Aditya collected proof of the faulty buildings against builder Digvijay, who bribed everyone and tried to bribe Aditya too by offering Rs. 10 million to spare the matter, but Aditya spurned the offer by fighting everyone in the room and nearly killing Digvijay. Aditya spared him when the latter asked for forgiveness, but Digvijay brutally retaliated by hitting him with an axe and left him for dead. However, a bus full of medical students found the unconscious Aditya on a highway and saved his life. He then decided to use the power of idealistic, young, honest youths and trained students at National College to join his cause. Meanwhile, Sadhuram finds that all the honest officers attended National College for graduation. Shruti discovers that Aditya is the real Gabbar and is shocked but when he tells her the truth, she supports his cause.

CBI officer Kuldeep Pahwa takes charge of the case and is mystified by the facts. He listens to Sadhuram's findings, and they arrest the National College students listed by Sadhuram, but upon being beaten, the students do not divulge anything about Gabbar, which enrages him further. Shruti tells Kuldeep that because the law doesn't work, a vigilante like Gabbar has become a hero for ordinary citizens. Sadhuram changes his view of Gabbar. Digvijay kills an honest officer to terrorize others into passing his faulty building plans. Gabbar targets Digvijay for his act. Digvijay throws a birthday party for himself, and as he cuts the cake, he spots Aditya. Aditya and his gang kidnap him. As police search the city for Digvijay in vain, Aditya kills Digvijay in a fight that ensues between the two, following which he surrenders himself to the police and is eventually given a death penalty , sparking huge public protests and enraged students block his jail van. Kuldeep requests him to speak to the students and he does, telling them to channel their anger against corruption and be the change society needs. Finally, while being prepared to be hanged, Aditya remarks that he will die but the movement will live on.

The songs of Gabbar Is Back were composed by Chirantan Bhatt , Yo Yo Honey Singh and Manj Musik , while the lyrics were written by Manoj Yadav, Kumaar , Sahil Kaushal, Manj Musik , Raftaar and Big Dhillon.

Aditya collected proof of the faulty buildings against builder Digvijay, who bribed everyone and tried to bribe Aditya too by offering Rs. 10 million to spare the matter, but Aditya spurned the offer by fighting everyone in the room and nearly killing Digvijay. Aditya spared him when the latter asked for forgiveness, but Digvijay brutally retaliated by hitting him with an axe and left him for dead. However, a bus full of medical students found the unconscious Aditya on a highway and saved his life. He then decided to use the power of idealistic, young, honest youths and trained students at National College to join his cause. Meanwhile, Sadhuram finds that all the honest officers attended National College for graduation. Shruti discovers that Aditya is the real Gabbar and is shocked but when he tells her the truth, she supports his cause.

CBI officer Kuldeep Pahwa takes charge of the case and is mystified by the facts. He listens to Sadhuram's findings, and they arrest the National College students listed by Sadhuram, but upon being beaten, the students do not divulge anything about Gabbar, which enrages him further. Shruti tells Kuldeep that because the law doesn't work, a vigilante like Gabbar has become a hero for ordinary citizens. Sadhuram changes his view of Gabbar. Digvijay kills an honest officer to terrorize others into passing his faulty building plans. Gabbar targets Digvijay for his act. Digvijay throws a birthday party for himself, and as he cuts the cake, he spots Aditya. Aditya and his gang kidnap him. As police search the city for Digvijay in vain, Aditya kills Digvijay in a fight that ensues between the two, following which he surrenders himself to the police and is eventually given a death penalty , sparking huge public protests and enraged students block his jail van. Kuldeep requests him to speak to the students and he does, telling them to channel their anger against corruption and be the change society needs. Finally, while being prepared to be hanged, Aditya remarks that he will die but the movement will live on.

The songs of Gabbar Is Back were composed by Chirantan Bhatt , Yo Yo Honey Singh and Manj Musik , while the lyrics were written by Manoj Yadav, Kumaar , Sahil Kaushal, Manj Musik , Raftaar and Big Dhillon.

The film was initially named as Runningshaadi.com . However, leading matrimonial site shaadi.com sued the makers for their company's name appearing in the movie title. They appealed to Bombay High Court and asked for damage repayment worth 50 crores. Thus, the title was trimmed to Running Shaadi . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]

The music of Shoojit Sircar's films has always received high critical and commercial success. His film Vicky Donor was commercially successful, and its audio was hugely popular. The music of his films Madras Cafe and Piku is very unconventional as well.

The music from Running Shaadi has been created by an assembled team taking the feel of mixed cult. The music is by Anupam Roy , Abhishek-Akshay and Zeb and features the voices of singers like Bappi Lahiri, [ 7 ] Papon , & Labh Janjua .

Ra.One,tt1562871,"In London , Jenny Nair, an employee of UK -based company Barron Industries, introduces a new technology that allows things from the digital world to enter the real world using wireless transmissions from multiple devices. Shekhar Subramaniam, who also works for the company, is given a final chance to devise a unique video game. To impress his skeptical son Prateek and upon the request of his wife Sonia, Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be more powerful than the protagonist.

Shekhar's colleague Akashi does the motion capture of the game's characters, Jenny does the programming, and Shekhar gives his face to the game's protagonist, G. One, while the antagonist, Ra. One, is faceless and has substantially greater powers than those granted to G. One, including shapeshifting and mind reading. Ra. One is imbibed with a self-learning AI . The two characters are given a H.A.R.T, which gives them powers, but also without which they cannot be killed. The game has three levels, and either of the players can only be killed in the third level using a special gun that holds a single bullet, which destroys the opponent's H.A.R.T. While designing the game, Akashi notices some malfunctions but ignores them. When the game is finally launched, it receives a standing ovation, and Prateek is so impressed that he insists on playing it immediately.

Prateek logs in under the alias Lucifer and proceeds to the final level but is interrupted by Akashi. The self-aware Ra. One, being unable to end his turn with Lucifer, becomes determined that Lucifer shall die. When the mainframe fails to shut down, Akashi calls Shekhar, who notices a problem with the game. Ra. One uses the new technology to enter the real world, breaks free, and goes to find Lucifer. Ra. One first assumes Akashi's form and asks him about Lucifer. When Akashi fails to reply, Ra. One abruptly murders him. After finding the dead Akashi, Shekhar rushes home, but is confronted on the way by Ra. One. In an attempt to save Prateek, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but Ra. One scans Shekhar's ID and kills him after discovering that he is lying.

Prateek notices the strange circumstances of his father's death and realises that Ra. One has come to life. Prateek and Jenny attempt to bring G.One to life. Meanwhile, Sonia tells Prateek that the family will return to India. Having taken the form of Akashi, Ra. One chases them, but G. One enters the real world through Jenny's computer and after a fight with Ra. One, causes a gas explosion, which breaks Ra. One into cubes and temporarily disables him. G. One takes Ra. One's H.A.R.T., without which Ra. One is weakened but also cannot die. Sonia finds she cannot leave G. One and takes him along with them to India through Shekhar's passport. G. One promises Sonia that he will protect Prateek from all harm. Ra. One returns to life takes the form of a billboard model and tracks G. One and Prateek by infiltrating Baron's office.

During Prateek's birthday party, Ra. One hypnotizes Sonia, assumes her form, and kidnaps Prateek. Ra. One then instructs G. One to give him his H.A.R.T. back and sends the real Sonia in an uncontrollable Mumbai Suburban Railway train. G. One saves Sonia just in the nick of time despite the train crashing and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus getting destroyed. He had a brief moment with Sonia and returns to save Prateek. The game resumes with Prateek controlling G. One's moves. Following a lengthy fight, they successfully beat the first and second levels and reach the third level. With little power left, G. One and Prateek trick Ra. One into shooting G. One without his H.A.R.T. attached as he shields it with his hand, which leaves Ra. One helpless.

Furious, Ra. One creates ten copies of himself. Prateek is unable to differentiate the real Ra. One, and asks G.One to quote one of Shekhar's sayings, which was actually a hint in disguise: ""If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you."" The pair then realise that only one of the ten Ra. Ones has a shadow. G. One shoots and destroys him. After absorbing Ra.One's remains, G. One transports himself back into the digital world. Several months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where Prateek finally manages to restore G. One to the real world.

Additionally, Priyanka Chopra and Sanjay Dutt appears in cameos as the Desi Girl and Khal Nayak , respectively. [ 17 ] Amitabh Bachchan provides the voiceover for the introduction sequence of the game 'Ra.One' in the film. The character Chitti , played by Rajinikanth , from Enthiran appears in the film. The character is computer-generated and is not played by the actor himself. [ 18 ]

According to director Anubhav Sinha , the idea of Ra.One originated in 2005 when he saw an advertisement on television which showed children remotely controlling a human. He was attracted to the concept and wrote a script based on it. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Sinha then approached Shah Rukh Khan , who liked the story and decided to produce the film under his production company Red Chillies Entertainment . [ 20 ] Sinha wasn't sure about retaining Khan's support after the former's previous film Cash (2007) became a commercial failure , but Khan reportedly ""remained unchanged"". [ 20 ]

Khan felt that the film possessed significant commercial potential in addition to being a fulfilment of his ""childhood dream"" to be a superhero and to fly. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] He stated that he wanted to ""make a film that gives me the right to deserve the iconic status that I've got for 20 years"", and also said that he wanted to make a film dedicated to father-son relationships, which were, in his opinion, ""neglected"" in Bollywood. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Khan's idea was to make a simple family drama which expanded into an action film . [ 26 ] He declined to make the film in English to increase its appeal for Western audiences, feeling that ""cracking Hollywood on their terms"" was unnecessary. [ 27 ] Both Khan and Sinha credited their children for providing encouragement and regularly ""approving"" the film's execution. [ 20 ]

Red Chillies Entertainment continued to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of Ra.One . [ 28 ] After providing the visual effects for My Name Is Khan (2010), the studio focused solely on Ra.One and did not take up any other films. [ 29 ] Khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film, including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar , but they declined; eventually, Sinha was made as the film's director. [ 30 ] To prepare the film's premises and characterisation, Sinha spent several months viewing video clips, digital art portals and comic books . [ 22 ] Sinha and Khan also watched around 200 superhero films from all over the world. [ 31 ] The storyboards were designed by Atul Chouthmal, who was contracted after he met Khan at Yash Raj Studios . While the former began work on the storyboards, the producers hired a storyboard artist from Hollywood. Chouthmal revealed that Khan and the other artist differed on their visions of the film, and so he was brought back. [ 32 ] Before filming, Khan reportedly took tips from actor Kamal Haasan regarding the production of large-scale films, having been impressed by Haasan's Dasavathaaram (2008). [ 33 ]

The title of the film received significant media attention due to it being the name of the antagonist rather than the protagonist. [ 35 ] The move was considered innovative and noted as a sign of the ""rising importance of the villain in Bollywood."" [ 36 ] [ 37 ] According to Sinha, the title had not been planned as such, and was ultimately chosen because Ra.One ""sounded cooler"" than G.One . [ 38 ] Khan was advised to name the film after his own character; he declined to do so, citing the inter-dependence between good and evil. [ 39 ] He also called Alfred Hitchcock as his inspiration, and pointed out that the antagonists in films like Sholay , Mr. India and Sadak were better remembered than the protagonists. [ 34 ] [ 35 ]

Shah Rukh Khan was the first actor to be cast in the film. [ 20 ] Kareena Kapoor , Priyanka Chopra and Asin had initially been considered for the lead female role; Kareena Kapoor was ultimately chosen because she insisted on playing the part. [ 40 ] Arjun Rampal accepted the role of Ra.One after Anubhav Sinha expressed a strong desire to cast him in the film. [ 41 ] Tom Wu was contracted to the film in July 2010 and Shahana Goswami was cast one month later. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Amitabh Bachchan agreed to be a part of the film after being requested by Khan and Sinha. [ 44 ] Several cast members prepared extensively for their roles; Rampal and Kapoor followed special diets to lose weight, [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Khan and Verma performed their own stunts and Kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance. [ 47 ] [ 27 ] [ 48 ]

The cast encountered problems during production, Khan faced difficulties with his superhero suit and prosthetic makeup and injured his left knee. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] The decision to cast Rampal was met with scepticism due to ""questionable acting abilities"", a statement Sinha criticised. [ 21 ] In addition, Rampal encountered back problems (which were treated by the time production began), [ 41 ] prompting speculation of a possible replacement by Vivek Oberoi . [ 52 ] Jackie Chan had initially been approached for the role of Aakaashi, but he declined the offer. [ 53 ] Rajinikanth suffered from health problems which caused a delay in the filming of his cameo appearance. [ 54 ] Sanjay Dutt faced a scheduling conflict with Agneepath (2012), which was later resolved. [ 55 ]

The crew of Ra.One featured both Indian and overseas personnel. Nicola Pecorini served as the director of photography with V. Manikandan providing assistance. [ 22 ] Andy Gill and Spiro Razatos were hired as the stunt supervisors, and Nino Pansini was hired as the stunt cinematographer. Sabu Cyril and Marcus Wookey were responsible for the production design. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] The film's producer was Bobby Chawla, but Gauri Khan later stepped in after the former suffered a brain haemorrhage . [ 58 ] Filming took place at a number of studios, notably Filmistan Studios , Film City and Yash Raj Studios in India and the Black Hangar Studios in the UK . [ 59 ]

Principal photography was initially set to begin in Miami , but the idea was abandoned due to budget constraints. [ 60 ] The first phase of filming began in Goa on 21 March 2010 and continued until May. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The second and third phases took place in London with the entire cast, beginning in July 2010 and ending in August. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The next phase was split into two schedules; the first schedule commenced at Filmistan Studios in the first week of September 2010, while the second schedule began in December 2010 and took place over a seven-day period. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The remaining portions were filmed in July 2011 at Film City. [ 66 ] A cameo appearance and a music video were filmed in the weeks leading up to the release, the former at the Whistling Woods Studios in Mumbai. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]

Ra.One featured three major action sequences, which were filmed in sets and real locations across Mumbai and London. The cinematography borrowed ideas from video games , such as rapid transitions between first-person and third-person perspectives. [ 57 ] Procedures such as bullet time were also incorporated into the film. [ 69 ] The production design was closely associated with the lighting and cinematography to facilitate smooth filming. [ 57 ] However, filming faced a number of difficulties including increasing costs, delays and safety constraints. [ 38 ] In addition, differences between Khan and Sinha caused tensions on the sets. [ 58 ]

As with the filming crew, the post-production crew of the film included both Indian and overseas personnel. [ 70 ] Prime Focus carried out the film's 3-D conversion with London-based colorist Richard Fearon performing the colour grading . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Red Chillies VFX partnered with a number of visual effects studios around the world and undertook the incorporation of the visual effects under the supervision of Jeffrey Kleiser. [ 21 ] [ 73 ] Nvidia provided the information technology–based software utilised for the effects, while Edwark Quirk supervised over the computer-generated imagery used in the film. [ 74 ] [ 71 ] Resul Pookutty was responsible for the film's sound design . [ 22 ]

The idea for converting the film to 3-D was put forth during filming, and was implemented in July 2011 due to a revived interest in 3-D films. [ 20 ] The process required 2,600 artists to convert 4,400 shots of the film. [ 72 ] The sound design involved bridging the real and the virtual world, [ 75 ] and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the Dolby Surround 7.1 system. [ 22 ] Incorporating the visual effects began in April 2010, [ 76 ] and was preceded by extensive research. [ 29 ] 1,200 artists worked for 2 1 ⁄ 2 years to complete the visual effects work. [ 77 ] A number of complex procedures were executed, including cubical transformations and the design of the faceless form of Ra.One. [ 29 ] [ 69 ]

Despite precautions, [ 21 ] the post-production faced significant delays owing to the digital inter-mediation , [ 78 ] increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, [ 79 ] and delays in the completion of the visual effects. [ 80 ] The post-production also faced budget constraints [ 73 ] and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. [ 57 ] The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. [ 80 ] Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time. [ 78 ] [ 81 ]

The bodysuits worn by Khan and Rampal were designed by Robert Kurtzman and Tim Flattery, and made by a team of specialists based in Los Angeles . [ 82 ] Sinha spent around three months conceptualising the costumes, watching various superhero films to design a costume, which is not created already. He then wrote a 23-page document with his sketches and details of what he wanted and gave it to the designers to work upon. [ 20 ] To create the suit, Khan was required to enter a small chamber where a warm latex-like liquid was released up to his neck and allowed to solidify, forming the mould which was then peeled off his body. The suit was joined by a concealed zipper and subsequently modified. [ 83 ] Computer-generated embellishments such as light beams and electricity were added to the suits after Khan expressed dissatisfaction with the initial rushes of the film. [ 84 ] A total of 21 costumes were made for the film, with each suit reportedly costing ₹ 10 million (US$120,000). [ 85 ]

Khan's suit was made of reinforced latex , coloured steel-blue and fitted with micro-computer circuitry. [ 83 ] Rampal's suit was made of three-inch thick solid rubber, and was red in colour. Both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact. [ 45 ] Wearing the suits created a number of difficulties for the actors. It took 20 minutes to put on the suits and 40 minutes to remove them. [ 45 ] In addition, the non-porous nature of the suits created intense heat inside, causing excessive perspiration despite the presence of special air conditioning ducts. [ 49 ] Khan later felt that the suits' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day; digital adjustments to the suits brought ""all the efforts to naught"". [ 24 ]

Manish Malhotra designed the look and the costume of Kareena Kapoor for the song "" Chammak Challo "", which received widespread media coverage. [ 86 ] Kapoor wore a red sari draped in the style of a dhoti . [ 87 ] Since the release of the song, the costume was termed a ""fashion rage"", [ 88 ] becoming popular in India and some overseas countries. Fashion experts applauded the costume and Kapoor's ability to carry it off ""stunningly"", though certain experts dismissed the naming of the sari colour. [ 86 ]

The soundtrack of Ra.One was composed by Vishal–Shekhar , with the lyrics being written by Panchhi Jalonvi, Vishal Dadlani and Kumaar . [ 89 ] A. R. Rahman provided the background score for a single sequence. [ 90 ] Sinha announced that R&B singer Akon and the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra would be a part of the soundtrack; [ 89 ] the former lent his vocals for "" Chammak Challo "" and ""Criminal"", while the latter performed in ""Bhare Naina"". The composers obtained the official license to use Ben E. King 's "" Stand By Me "", on which they based the song ""Dildaara"". [ 89 ] The soundtrack contains fifteen tracks, including seven original songs, four remixes, three instrumentals and an international version of ""Chammak Challo"". [ 89 ] The music rights were bought by T-Series for ₹ 150 million (US$1.8 million). [ 22 ] The Hindi version of the soundtrack was released on 21 September 2011; the Tamil version was released on 5 October 2011 and Telugu version was released on 9 October 2011 respectively, featuring six tracks each. [ 91 ]

The producers of Ra.One spent ₹ 100 million (US$1.2 million) out of a ₹ 520 million (US$6.2 million) marketing budget, [ 92 ] ₹ 150 million (US$1.8 million) of this was utilised for internet promotions alone. [ 93 ] The film's first theatrical poster was released in December 2010, [ 26 ] and was followed by the release of two teaser trailers during the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . [ 94 ] The first theatrical trailer premiered three months later. [ 95 ] Khan and Sinha undertook a multi-city tour during which they unveiled a 3,600 feet-long piece of fan mail to collect audience messages. [ 96 ] The official website of Ra.One was launched on 31 May 2011, and an official YouTube channel for the film was subsequently unveiled. [ 97 ] On 20 October 2011, Khan held a live chat with fans on Google Plus , the first time an Indian film personality had done so. [ 98 ] Rampal's look in the film, which had been kept secret, [ 99 ] was revealed in late October 2011. [ 100 ]

The film's marketing utilised merchandise and games to facilitate the creation of a franchise. [ 101 ] Khan marketed merchandise related to the film, [ 102 ] which included toys, PC tablets and apparel. [ 103 ] On 14 October 2011, a gaming tournament featuring games like Call of Duty was conducted in Mumbai and telecast live on YouTube. [ 104 ]

Red Chillies Entertainment partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe to create ""Ra.One – The Game "", a game for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 which was released on 5 October 2011. [ 105 ] The producers further collaborated with UTV Indiagames to design a social game titled Ra.One Genesis , with an independent plot based on G.One, [ 101 ] in addition to designing digital comics based on the film's characters. [ 106 ]

In India, the Hindi version of Ra.One was released across more than 4,000 plus screens worldwide- 3,100 screens in 2,100 theatres, breaking the record for the widest Hindi film's release previously held by Salman Khan 's Bodyguard (2011). [ 107 ] [ 108 ] The Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 275 prints and 125 prints respectively. [ 109 ] A week before the release, multiplex owners throughout India decided to allot 95% of the total available screen space to the film. [ 110 ] Overseas, Ra.One was released in 904 prints. [ 111 ] This including 600 prints in Germany, 344 prints in the US, 200–300 prints in South Korea, 202 prints in the UK, 79 prints in the Middle East, 75 prints in Russia, 51 prints in Australia, 49 prints in Canada and 25 prints in New Zealand and Taiwan. [ 112 ] In early October 2011, a partnership deal was being finalised by the distributors to allow the film to be released in China across 1,000 prints. [ 113 ] In addition, the film was released in Pakistan and non-traditional territories like Brazil, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hong Kong. [ 114 ] The 3D version was released in 550 screens across the world. [ 107 ] Ra.One was noted for the extensive use of digital prints, reportedly making up 50–60% of the total release; [ 113 ] in India, the film was exhibited in over 1,300 digital theatres , breaking the record previously held by Bodyguard . [ 107 ] The wide digital release was implemented to lower distribution costs, make the film accessible to a wider audience and reduce piracy. [ 113 ] Despite the measures taken, pirated versions of Ra.One were available on the Internet within hours of the film's release. [ 115 ]

In May 2011, the first rushes of Ra.One were shown to the cast of Khan's other home production Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011). [ 116 ] Subsequently, the film was screened for test audiences to study and gauge the film's appeal across different age groups. [ 117 ] A few days prior to the theatrical release, Khan arranged a special screening of the film's final cut in Yash Raj Studios, where he invited close friends, his family and the film's crew. [ 118 ] Between 24 and 26 October 2011, Ra.One had international premieres in Dubai, London and Toronto, all of which were chosen due to their international significance and large South Asian populations. [ 119 ] The premiere in Dubai was held on 24 October 2011 at the Grand Cinemas, Wafi . A high-profile dinner and charity auction followed, where Khan raised AED 30,000 (approximately US$8,200) to build a workshop for children with special needs. [ 120 ] The premiere included three simultaneous screenings of the film, for which tickets were placed on sale for the public. [ 121 ] The premiere in London took place at the O 2 Cineworld the following day, and the premiere in Toronto took place at the TIFF Bell Lightbox on 26 October 2011. [ 122 ]

Ra.One was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification on 14 October 2011 to receive its viewership rating. The Board raised strong objections to the film's action scenes, fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts. The police and the Indian Railways security force had made similar objections to the train-based stunts in the film, claiming that youngsters would ""blindly imitate them"" and hence put their lives at risk. [ 123 ] The film was finally passed with a 'U' certificate without cuts, but under the condition that prominent disclaimers were shown, stating that the stunts were computer-generated and should not be imitated. [ 124 ] The British Board of Film Classification rated the film 12A for ""moderate fantasy violence"". [ 1 ] In March 2012, a Mid-Day report alleged that Ra.One had received a favourable rating, pointing out that the producers had violated the rules by meeting the Board officials during the screening. [ 125 ]

The television broadcasting rights for Ra.One were bought by Star India for a then-record sum of ₹350 million , surpassing 3 Idiots (2009). [ 126 ] The Indian television premiere of Ra.One took place on 21 January 2012 on STAR Gold , garnering a 28% market sharefor the channel and a TVR of 6.7. [ 127 ] Star India subsequently syndicated the television screening rights to Disney XD , where it premiered on 2 June 2012. [ 128 ] In May 2012, International Media Distribution announced that Ra.One would be televised on Comcast and Cox , as a part of the celebrations of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Month . [ 129 ] Discovery Channel tied up with Red Chillies Entertainment to produce a one-hour program titled "" Revealed: The Making of Ra.One "", which aired on the channel on 30 March 2012. The program discussed the making of the film in detail, including the visual effects and the challenges faced while filming. [ 69 ]

Eros International released the DVD of Ra.One on 13 December 2011 across all regions in one-disc and two-disc packs complying with the NTSC format. [ 130 ] The DVD of the film contained alternate endings . Initially, Khan had wanted to add alternate endings to the theatrical release itself, but later deemed it risky. The DVD version was made interactive as well. [ 131 ] VCD and Blu-ray versions of the film were also released. [ 132 ] [ 133 ]

The German Blu-ray edition was released on 1 June 2012 by Rapid Eye Movies. [ 134 ] On 24 July 2013, French distributor Condor released the film as Voltage on 3D Blu-ray. It was released in a SteelBook edition containing the 3D/2D Blu-ray discs and the DVD. [ 135 ] The same year, Japanese distributor Maxam released the Blu-ray on 27 September 2013. [ 136 ]

The film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), the Batman series, Iron Man (2008), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010) and Tron: Legacy (2010). [ 137 ] [ 138 ] Khan denied the allegations, saying, ""I got inspired from a lot of superhero movies but the movie is original. In fact, Ra.One will be the first superhero-based movie in the world in which the superhero lives in a family."" [ 139 ]

A few days before the release, screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that Ra.One resembled a concept that he had developed several years before. Patnaik appealed to the Bombay High Court to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit. [ 140 ] The court, observing prima facie evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit ₹ 10 million (US$120,000) with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film. Patnaik challenged the court's decision and demanded that the producers give him credit and not cash. [ 141 ] Sinha later claimed that he alone had developed the film's story. [ 142 ]

Ra.One also faced cybertheft and hacking issues. On 3 June 2011, three days after its launch, the official website of the film was hacked by suspected Pakistani cyber criminals who stated that the act was in revenge for a similar attack on a Karachi press club website. The hackers defaced the homepage and left a note threatening the Indian Press Club. [ 143 ] Despite precautions, the song ""Chammak Challo"" was leaked several months before the official release of the soundtrack. Khan clarified that the leaked song was a ""rough version"" of the actual song, and that the person responsible for the leak was being looked for. He subsequently refuted claims that the leak had been engineered as a publicity stunt. [ 144 ]

The sequence in the film where Shah Rukh Khan's character mixes curd with noodles was not well received by South Indians. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] His frequent usage of the words “ayyo” ( transl. oh god ) and “rascal” while attempting to speak Tamil was also perceived as inaccurate while Kareena Kapoor 's usage of ""condom condom"" instead of ""konjam konjam"" ( transl. little little ) was perceived as offensive and was not present in the dubbed versions. [ 147 ] [ 148 ]

In India, Ra.One debuted at the beginning of the five-day Diwali weekend, and subsequently broke the Diwali opening day record. [ 152 ] The film then set the records for the biggest single-day net revenue and the biggest three-day opening weekend earned by a Hindi film, breaking the previous records held by Bodyguard . [ 153 ] [ 154 ]

Subsequently, the film began to suffer significant drops in its collections, with its five-day extended weekend and nine-day extended week coming second to the records of Bodyguard . [ 155 ] The film faced an 84 percent drop in collections in its second week and fell a further 90 percent in its third week, the latter primarily due to the release of Rockstar . [ 156 ] [ 157 ] The dubbed versions showed similar trends. [ 155 ] The Tamil and Telugu versions together earned around ₹50 million nett. [ 151 ]

In overseas markets, Ra.One earned the highest three-day and five-day opening weekends among the Hindi film releases of 2011; [ 158 ] [ 159 ] by its second weekend, the film had become the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2011 in overseas markets, but the collections suffered drops throughout. [ 160 ] In general, families and children formed the major portion of the film's audience, [ 161 ] and the 3D version is regarded as a success. [ 162 ]

The budget of Ra.One was the subject of significant speculation prior to its release. A number of estimates placed the budget between ₹ 1.4 billion (US$17 million) [ 163 ] and ₹ 2.0 billion (US$24 million). It was universally accepted that the film was the most expensive Bollywood film of all time, [ 103 ] with certain sources stating that the film was the most expensive Indian film ever. [ 164 ] The original budget was revealed to be ₹ 1.30 billion (US$15 million) after promotional expenses. [ 151 ] Khan stated that he had ""worked very hard"" to finance the film without borrowing money, [ 165 ] and reportedly hosted a television show just to finance the film. [ 166 ] Ra.One earned ₹ 1.32 billion (US$16 million) from pre-release revenue sources, setting a new record for Bollywood films. [ 167 ]

The extensive marketing campaign greatly increased audience expectations of the film. Ra.One set records for the level of pre-release buzz for an Indian film, [ 97 ] and also topped a number of polls gauging the most awaited Bollywood films of the year. [ 168 ] [ 169 ] Anticipation for the film was equally high among the trade analysts, with some commenting that the film would pass the ₹ 1 billion (US$12 million) mark in one week and the ₹ 3 billion (US$35 million) mark in over three weeks. [ 126 ] Advance bookings commenced on 20 October 2011 on a limited scale, and expanded later. While initial ticket sales were low, [ 170 ] they picked up considerably near the release date. A few days prior to the release, the advance booking was described as ""phenomenal"", [ 170 ] with an overall advance booking rate of 20–25% across the country. [ 171 ] A number of advantages of the film's release were pointed out, such as the festive season and higher 3D ticket prices, though there had been doubt regarding the timely release of the 3D version. [ 172 ]

Upon release, Ra.One received mixed reviews from critics in India [ 173 ] and generally positive reviews overseas. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported a 61% approval rating, based on 23 reviews with an average rating of 5.41/10. [ 174 ] On Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean from film reviews, Ra.One holds a rating of 60% based on eight reviews, signifying ""mixed or average reviews"". [ 175 ]

Positive reviews described the film as an ambitious initiative and a technological success, with some critics thinking that Ra.One had put Indian films on par with Hollywood. [ 179 ] [ 180 ] The visual effects received near-universal praise, though dissenting opinions stated that they were ""all over the place"". [ 181 ] The action sequences were also widely praised. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Other aspects of the film received more polarising opinions, and one very positive review was criticised for ""over-rating"" the film. [ 184 ] Mixed views were opined regarding the plot's gaming concept, with some critics deeming it ""far-fetched"" and others lauding the ""gaming-style aesthetics"". [ 174 ] [ 185 ] Similarly, some critics called the emotional scenes ""fulfilling"" while others felt them to be ""lacking in connect with the audience"". [ 186 ] [ 187 ] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a 1.5 out of 5 star rating explaining that "" Ra.One is a subpar superhero film with a mediocre soundtrack and occasionally terrific effects. For those of you looking to compare, it's well below Krrish on the super-pecking order, and far, far below Robot ."" [ 188 ]

The story was negatively received by several critics, with a number of them deeming it to be disappointing and lacking in originality; [ 182 ] [ 189 ] one critic praised the original idea but criticised its ""Bollywoodization"". [ 190 ] The direction was criticised in a number of reviews, though a few critics praised Sinha's pacing of the film and the execution of the action sequences. [ 183 ] [ 185 ] Some critics pointed to the presence of scenes which were not child-friendly, despite Ra.One being promoted as a children's film. [ 191 ] Particular reviews criticised the lack of character development and the film's ""incoherently hackneyed morality"". [ 192 ] [ 193 ] A few critics panned the film as a whole, describing it as a ""mess""; [ 194 ] one review commented, ""It's convenient to say that if you have no expectations from the film, you wouldn't be disappointed."" [ 195 ]

After its release, Ra.One received numerous nominations and awards in India and abroad, a majority of them for its technical aspects. The film notably won the National Film Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Special Effects, [ 196 ] [ 197 ] and four International Indian Film Academy Awards . [ 198 ] The film also received several business awards for its marketing and distribution. [ 199 ]

Reports of a planned sequel of Ra.One began surfacing prior to the film's release, though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown. Both Khan and Sinha admitted to formulating plans for a sequel, though the former noted that it would be ""presumptuous"" to start the sequel before the first film's release. [ 201 ] Khan later refuted the speculations, saying that a sequel was unlikely due to his other commitments. [ 202 ] After Ra.One won a National Award, an ""overjoyed"" Khan said that the film's world could be further explored. He stated that the sequel, if made, would be titled G.One and not Ra.Two , and that he would make it ""faster, bigger and better"" than Ra.One . [ 203 ] Khan was reported to be looking for a script, without a fixed release date. [ 204 ] In April 2012, Mushtaq Sheikh said that the pre-production of the sequel had begun. [ 203 ] A number of reports stated that Kareena Kapoor would not be a part of the sequel. [ 205 ]

Despite Khan's enthusiasm for the idea of a sequel, the film industry expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker Rajkumar Gupta commented, ""It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier."" Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, ""It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made."" Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel ""a bad idea"". Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, ""If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was."" Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, ""Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment of your time and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?""

Dishoom,tt3679060,"During a cricket tournament in the Middle East , 48 hours prior to the final match between India and Pakistan, India's top cricketer Viraj Sharma goes missing. Indian authorities get a video tape of an unknown man wearing a Pakistani team jersey and claiming to have abducted Viraj till the India vs Pakistan cricket match two days later and warning them not to cancel the match or else Viraj will be killed. Attempting to avoid media outrage, Gayatri Shubha Mishra, the External Affairs Minister of India, sends special task force officer Kabir Shergill IPS to U.A.E for a 36-hour manhunt. [ 4 ] After being received by and getting into a semi-scuffle with a local officer, Saeed Naqvi, Kabir, who is a no-nonsense cop, bumps into a rookie Indo-Emirati police officer Junaid Ansari, who has never been able to solve a case but has a good knowledge of the town which he acquired during his first incomplete case of finding a dog named Bradman. Both Kabir and Junaid start their investigation with a CCTV footage of Viraj's hotel and find out that on the night of his disappearance, Viraj went out with a local girl, Samira Dalal. On confronting her, they learn that she took Viraj to a friend's birthday party but he left soon.

Later, they roam around the town to meet a local goon nicknamed Khabri Chacha, who directs them to Sameer Gazi, the city's biggest party animal who met Viraj in the same party, but are still unable to lay hands on any clue. Finally, the duo gets a breakthrough by tracking down Viraj's cellphone from the apartment of a pickpocket, Ishika, who claims to have stolen the cell phone from a stranger, the previous night, in a supermarket. During this time, Junaid finally finds Bradman and vows to never lose track of him, tying a tracker band around his neck, containing a hidden camera. The duo also manages to capture the person in the video, but discovers that he is just a struggling actor being used as the face in the video by the real kidnapper. However, Junaid is shocked when the actor recognizes the ""stranger"" Ishika had mentioned as the fugitive who conducted his audition, and rubs a sketch clue of evidence out to Kabir, who asks Saeed, Junaid's superior, to identify the stranger. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the real kidnapper is a cricket bookie Wagah, who along with his assistant Altaf, the stranger, has abducted Viraj and offered him 300 million rupees to under play in the final.

They finally close the deal for 500 million, but when the deal didn't work out and Viraj closeted onto them, bluffing an imposterly Wagah into believing he would underplay, they kidnap him permanently till the final match is played. Kabir, a suspended-from-duty Junaid and Ishika go to an underground Arabian club in Altaf's native state Abuddin, full of goons and guns, where Ishika helps Kabir and Junaid by distracting the goons and later Kabir rescues her from them. During the journey, Junaid reveals to Ishika that Kabir suffered from cancer and was betrayed for this reason by his girlfriend Alishka Iyer, having lost his smile ever since. Hearing this, Ishika warms up to Kabir, clicking and sending photos of both together while he is still asleep, to Alishka, with whom he had a breakup after he caught her cheating on him with customs officer Vishal Sinha, Kabir's former colleague. Kabir spots Altaf and both try to chase him down but before they could succeed, a sniper kills Altaf. Wagah calls and confesses to Kabir that he got him killed and they should stop searching for Viraj. Wagah confronts Viraj, threatens to kill his family, shoots both a Mumbai-based partner and his own manager, and asks his wife to leave with their son, finally stranded, with only Bradman, revealed to be their family dog, by his side.

On returning to Abu Dhabi , Kabir and Junaid are taken off the case and Kabir ordered to fly back to India. Seeing Kabir walk towards the airport, Ishika goes soft and confesses her feelings for Kabir to Junaid. At the 11th hour, Junaid gets a clue of Viraj's whereabout through the camera on Bradman's neck band, as Wagah has hidden him in a yacht near the team's hotel. Both reach the location only to discover that Wagah has fled leaving behind Viraj tied with a time bomb after Wagah realised that Bradman carried a GPS tracker. With only minutes left for the bomb to blast, Kabir negotiates with Wagah to stop the bomb in return of 5 billion rupees from the Indian Government. Wagah takes the money but refuses to stop the bomb. After witnessing the blast from a distance, Wagah walks into the cricket stadium expecting the match to begin without Viraj, but to his shock, Viraj is alive and walks into the ground all ready to play as it is revealed that Kabir and Junaid helped Viraj to get out of the jacket by dislocating his shoulder and all three had jumped into water just before the blast. After seeing his plan failed, Wagah tries to escape only to be apprehended by the duo. Kabir, who now has feelings for Ishika, returns to India along with her, while Junaid, who regains his duty, gets a marriage proposal from an Indian girl, Muskaan and also flies to India to meet her.

Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times gave 3/5 stars and wrote ""Dishoom is a silly but fun reworking of the time-tested buddy cop formula.

Jolly LLB,tt2621000,"In 2009, Advocate Jagdish Tyagi, also known as Jolly, is a Delhi-based lawyer living with his sister's husband, Pratap, and is in a relationship with Sandhya. He happens to witness prominent criminal defense lawyer, Advocate Tejinder Rajpal, successfully defend Rahul Dewan, a boy from a high-society family in a sessions court , who has been accused of drunk driving in a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado and causing the deaths of six labourers sleeping on the footpath six months ago. Jolly, desperate for money and fame, decides to pursue the case and files a PIL in the court against Rahul Dewan. Jolly's neighbour, Kaul Saab gifts him his office as a chamber, because Kaul Saab's daughter was raped and murdered by a policeman's son, who was also successfully defended by Rajpal. Kaul Saab takes this to be an opportunity to receive some justice through Jolly.

After initially reprimanding Jolly for his mistakes in filing the PIL and presenting the press reports as evidence, Judge Sunderlal Tripathi warns Jolly to collect some valid evidence before the next hearing. Jolly then runs into Albert Pinto, who claims to have witnessed the accident, but soon learns that he is a lackey of Rajpal and was being used to extract more money from the Dewan family. As part of the deal, Pinto gives Jolly a share of the money and turns hostile in court. However, Sandhya and Kaul Saab chide Jolly for compromising on justice for his greed, provoking him to return the money to Rajpal and challenge him to win the case.

With the help of Pratap, Jolly collects the video footage of the car involved in the accident and presents it to the court. Rajpal counters that the car was driven by the Dewan family's driver and the footage was fake. Jolly refutes it by successfully cross-examining the driver, who finally admits that he had registered a false testimony. Judge Tripathi then orders the police to provide a bodyguard for Jolly after he is manhandled by Rajpal's colleagues. Although Sub-Inspector Satbir Rathi, who is also on Rajpal's payroll, tries to sabotage him, Jolly, with the help of his bodyguard, Constable Haldiram, leaves for Gorakhpur after learning that Sadakant Mishra, a survivor of the accident, stays there.

Jolly, after passing through many hurdles, successfully brings Mishra to the court. Rajpal tries to scuttle proceedings but the hesitant Tripathi overrules him. Mishra reveals the truth of the accident; that night, he and his relatives were sleeping on the footpath when Rahul Dewan drove his Land Cruiser over them, except Mishra. When he saw Mishra witnessing what he did, Rahul Dewan backed his car, hoping to run over him, but instead ran over his leg, resulting in it being amputated. Mishra also states that Rathi had threatened him after the accident and fabricated the investigation, and that he was only allowed to go after he offered his hard-earned money and jewellery for his sister's marriage to Rathi. Mishra also identifies Rahul Dewan as the one who drove the car. After the emotional closing arguments by Rajpal and Jolly, Tripathi directs the police department to suspend Rathi and initiate a criminal inquiry against him, and also declares Rahul Dewan as guilty of the crime and sentences him to seven years of imprisonment. As Jolly walks out receiving praises, Rajpal sits crestfallen over losing a case for the first time.

Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India rated it with 2.5 out of 5 stars and said - ""the lady seems to be so gullible and so easy to fool, it does seem unreal. It takes her eternity to realize her companion's true identity, even though the television keeps blaring out the truth. The duo try hard, but the romance never does light up the screen. Nor do the private lives of the mismatched couple throw up enticing moments that could hold the script together"". [ 8 ] Bollywood portal FilmiTadka wrote - ""Kucch Luv Jaisa starts off as a comedy movie, but takes a serious turn through performances of actors, for this film I would say great performers are thoroughly wasted, the script has various loopholes which could have been covered had the director invested some more time on script front, we at FilmiTadka give it 2 out of five stars."" [ 9 ] Shubha Shetty-Saha of MidDay wrote in her review - ""While busy yawning through this two-hour plus movie, I kept wondering, which women are they talking about? Is there a woman who gets so excited at the sight of a detective that she follows him into a hotel room? Is there a woman out there who thinks she has found some purpose in life, only if she struts around in high heels? If these women do exist, I am glad I haven't met them yet.  
Oh yes, the music was hummable and lyrics were nice"". [ 10 ]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Kucch_Luv_Jaisaa_Poster.jpg/220px-Kucch_Luv_Jaisaa_Poster.jpg
Rocky Handsome,tt3410408,"Based in a city in Goa , recluse Kabir Ahlawat lives a quiet life running a pawn shop . His next-door neighbor is Anna, a drug addict and bar dancer living with her little daughter Naomi, who develops a special bond with Kabir. ACP Dilip Sangodkar, who is working with the NCB alongside senior Goa police officer DCP Rebello, is after Mantoo, a crime boss supported by Kevin Ferriera and his brother Luke Ferriera, who control a mass racket in organ harvesting and drug manufacturing with Attila, a professional assassin.

One night, Anna and her boyfriend steal drugs from Mantoo's henchman Big Show. Anna hides the drugs in a camera and pawns it to Kabir. The consignment loss enrages Mantoo, who assigns Kevin to recover the stolen drugs. Luke and Attila reach Anna's place, where they torture Anna for the camera and Naomi becomes an eyewitness to the brutal torments. Unwittingly, Anna reveals the location of the drug as a response, where Big Show enters Kabir's house along with his man Viju Dempo, demanding the camera. Kabir is obliged to hand the camera to Luke when he tells him that Naomi and Anna are his captives.

Kabir gets a call from Kevin to make a delivery to Mantoo and promises to release them if the delivery is successful. Kabir delivers the drugs to Mantoo, where he finds that the cops have already raided Mantoo's haven. Mantoo flees and Kabir chases him, but is arrested by the cops when they find Anna's corpse with all her organs harvested in Kabir's car. Kevin brutally finishes Mantoo, claiming all his organs, and becomes the new drug lord.

During interrogation, Kabir escapes from the police station. The officers are bewildered by his combat skills and learn that he was a former decorated RAW soldier , who retired after his pregnant wife Rukshida was killed by stray terrorist gunfire outside a hospital. Kabir fights with Attila at a nightclub and is shot, but breaks into a medical shop and performs an impromptu surgery. Kabir then continues on his journey, where he finds and frees several child slaves in a drug manufacturing plant. Kabir kills Luke at the plant and tracks down Kevin, who tells him that he had Naomi killed and shows a container that has what he says are her eyes.

Enraged, Kabir kills all the gang members, including Attila and Kevin. As Kabir prepares to commit suicide out of grief, an unscathed Naomi arrives. It is revealed that Attila, who took pity on her because she had been kind to him, had spared her life -- the eyes in the container belonged to the gangsters' surgeon. Kabir gets arrested, but the officers allow Naomi to ride with him. Kabir asks them to stop at a convenience store , where he buys a backpack and school supplies for Naomi. Kabir asks her if she can manage until he returns, to which she agrees with him and the two embrace.

Firangi,tt7549484,"In the 1920s, Mangatram ""Manga"" is an uneducated, jobless young man who dreams of joining the Police Force but fails at every attempt made to do so. During a visit to the village Naku Guda for his friend Heera's wedding, Manga comes across Sargi and falls in love with her, but being jobless Manga is unable to move forward with his relationship with Sargi.

Manga was born with a unique ability that he could cure anyone's back-ache with a simple kick to the buttocks. One day he manages to cure Englishman Mark Daniel of his back-ache using the same technique. Impressed, Mark offers him a job in the Police Force, which Manga happily accepts. Manga is convinced that since he has a job now, Sargi's family won't object to his marriage with her and so he approaches Sargi's grandfather Lalaji. But Lalaji, who is a follower of Mahatma Gandhi , refuses the proposal because Manga is working for the British, the very people against whom the people of the Naku Guda are fighting for their freedom.

According to the film director Rajiev Dhingra and producer Kapil Sharma, the idea behind making Firangi was to tell a story set in pre- partition era without making the freedom movement of India , which was prevalent at that time, as its focal point. Kapil said that most films set in pre-independence era have been about the freedom struggle and the tragedies that took place at that time, so they decided to make a story which would focus on the day-to-day lives of people and the simple moments of happiness that they shared with each other. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]

Initially, the film was set to release on 10 November 2017, however on 12 October 2017 it was announced that the film would be releasing on 24 November 2017.

Jha gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5, and called it ""Deliriously Enjoyable Even For Non-Kapil Fans!"". He further stated that ""Those who think Kapil's days are numbered should make it a point to see what unrehearsed energy he brings to even the most mundane conversation about a bar of soap."" [ 26 ] Rajeev Masand of News18 gave the film a rating of 1.5 stars out of 5 and said that, ""Firangi is a bloated two-hour forty minute exercise designed to suggest that Kapil Sharma can act but to survive the film you need to be chained to your seat with toothpicks holding up your eyelids"". [ 27 ] Shristi Negi of News 18 gave the film a rating of 1.5 stars out of 5 and said that, ""The random execution of the movie fails to add anything of interest to the plot. Even with great supporting cast like Aanjjan Srivastav and Rajesh Sharma, the film feels frustratingly disjointed."". [ 28 ] Sweta Kausal of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 1 star out of 5 and said that, ""the boring narrative, an incoherent screenplay and mismatch between milieu and discourse in certain scenes of the film make it an extremely mind-numbing affair"". [ 29 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5 and criticized the film for its excessive length and inconsistent screenplay and said that, ""Neither the comic potential at the core of the film nor the energy of Kapil Sharma's antics is enough to pull it out of the irremediable mess it degenerates into."". [ 30 ]

Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5 saying that, ""Firangi moves at a snail's pace leading us to a semi-fun climax. Sadly, the film doesn't even fall into 'so bad, it's good' category. It is outright boring and thus not even perversely entertaining"". [ 31 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5 and said that, ""The trouble with this mildly engaging film, with a solid supporting cast, is that it is far too long."". [ 32 ] Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5 saying that, ""On the whole, due to its weak script and lack of comedy Firangi fails to leave a lasting impression. Besides this, the long run time of 161 mins will leave the audiences impatient and restless."". [ 33 ]

Nandini Ramnath of Scroll criticized the movie saying that, ""At 160 minutes, Rajiev Dhingra's movie is highly overstretched, and squanders its comic potential despite having a comedian as its hero."" [ 34 ] Aman Khurana of Times Now gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5 and said that, ""Packed with unappealing performances and a done-to-death storyline, Firangi is a below average affair.""

Phantom (2015 film),tt3469244,"The film begins with a car chase in Chicago , which leads to a scuffle between a man ostensibly named Jude Rosario and an American male known as Matthew Brody. The scuffle ends with Brody falling into the icy waters of Chicago River , and his body missing. This results in Rosario being arrested and convicted of murder.

A flashback to six months prior shows the office of the Indian RAW chief Roy, where he and his trusted men plan a daring covert operation. The man, known as Jude Rosario in the opening sequence, is shown to be Captain Daniyal Khan, a dead-end ex-soldier with a completely deadpan sense of life and death which is pulled out of oblivion and pressed into service by the spy agency to wreak vengeance on the men who planned the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks . He agrees on the assurance that he will be reinstated in the Indian army to the same rank from which he was court-martialled, which meant regaining the respect of his estranged father, retd. Col. Usman Khan, and mentee, Dilawar Singh. His only team member, Nawaz Mistry helps him find his first target Sajid Mir at a cricket match in London . On reaffirming his identity after breaking into his apartment, Daniyal rigs up an explosion which kills Sajid, which makes the headlines explaining it was accidental, resulting in an investigation by the Pakistani ISI .

In the present day, Daniyal, aka Jude, has landed in the same jail as David Headley , his next target. He contacts Nawaz in order to acquire money to buy a battery, as a replacement for another one which holds a certain poison. The poison, ( succinylcholine ), is untraceable as it can kill a person when it touches the tongue, causing a heart attack. After killing Headley by plugging the poisonous battery into a showerhead he usually uses, Brody, who supposedly died upon falling in the river, is found alive, and Daniyal is released as his earlier sentence is rendered null and void. Meanwhile, ISI agents gather information about him.

Daniyal and Nawaz travel to Syria via Lebanon , to get in touch with the fighters of Lashkar-e-Toiba . There, Daniyal is held captive by the L-e-T and is forced into revealing the purpose of killing Sajid Mir and David Headley, on camera. The chief of L-e-T in Syria tries his best to send the video of Daniyal's confession to ISI, but the war-torn situation of Syria has led to a mass disruption of communication networks. Nawaz, with her team of soldiers, kills the subordinates of L-e-T, much to the chagrin of Daniyal. Subsequently, Daniyal, Nawaz, and the team escape from the clutches of the L-e-T after a bloody gunfight. Daniyal manages to kill the Syrian chief of L-e-T, just before he is about to send the video to the ISI, and destroys the recordings. Subsequently, the ISI kills the Indian Consulate General of Jordan, Mr. Rajan Sampath, in a gas explosion, similar to the killing of Sajid Mir, as a revenge attack. The RAW chief Roy reprimands Daniyal for unnecessarily killing someone who was not meant to be killed and asks him to call off the mission. Nawaz encourages Daniyal to carry on the mission to avenge the 2008 Mumbai Attacks by killing the direct people who orchestrated the whole mission. She offers to take him and herself to Pakistan .

Daniyal and Nawaz go to Pakistan to take down the last two perpetrators, Sahabuddin Umvi and Haaris Saeed . There, they make plans of killing Saeed with the help of a local restaurant owner and RAW agent Khalid, by an explosive planted in the mic used during his public rally. However, their plan fails, leading Daniyal to pursue Saeed in a car and shoot him dead, also causing an explosion. Umvi is killed with the help of a nurse Amina Bi, a mother who lost her militant son in a suicide attack , who replaces his regular medicine with poison, later shooting herself after the police find her at her home.

With the Pakistani army and ISI pursuing them, Daniyal and Nawaz make their way to the coast to escape through the Arabian Sea . Their accomplices get caught and interrogated for information or are killed. While they are escaping on a boat, the Pakistani military finds out about it and sends patrol boats to apprehend them. While hiding in the waters with Nawaz, Daniyal gets shot by the military and dies. Nawaz later gets rescued by the Indian Navy , after they leave. Later, she goes to the Taj Hotel in Mumbai , where she meets a tea seller who was giving tea for free as his son, who was a waiter in the hotel and was killed by the terrorists in attacks, has now been avenged as Daniyal killed them. She buys two cups of tea from him, fulfilling a promise earlier made to Daniyal.

Bhoot Returns,tt2406636,"Tarun, an architect, moves into a luxurious bungalow with his wife, Namrata, and their children, 10-year-old Taman and 6-year-old Nimmi. During an exploration of the house, Nimmi finds a doll and includes someone named 'Shabbu' in all her activities. The family mistakes Nimmi's new doll to be Shabbu but is surprised when Nimmi points to an empty space and introduces her invisible friend as Shabbu. Her parents suspect her wild imagination is the reason for her new 'friend'.

Soon, Tarun's younger sister, Pooja, surprises the family with a visit. As Tarun, Namrata, and Pooja discuss Nimmi's fixation over Shabbu, the family servant, Laxman, is sure of a spirit's presence in the house . Laxman's worries receive severe backlash from Tarun, an ardent skeptic . Soon, each night at the bungalow seems to turn for the worse, with knocks at unearthly hours, demonic sounds, and eerie movements. Tarun suspects Laxman to be the mischief-maker, trying to prove his points. As Nimmi's fixation with Shabbu increases, the family decides to consult a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist explains Nimmi's imaginary friend as a result of her loneliness and terms it as a common technique used by children to grab attention.

Laxman's sudden disappearance and the increasing curiosity in Pooja to find answers for the ongoing activities make her install wireless cameras at various places in the house, which record Nimmi playing with what seems like a ghostly apparition . Tarun's mind starts reeling as he sees the captured footage; it is proof enough for the disturbed family to finally decide to leave the house. But the house has other plans: Nimmi is found missing the next morning. The police are called in to investigate, but they consider the family delusional and do not take much interest in the matter.

Tarun receives a mysterious phone call, Nimmi's voice from the upper floor, after which they find Laxman murdered. The house seems to be on lockdown, and the phones are jammed. Taman is mysteriously killed. Nimmi appears possessed by the spirit and tries to kill both her parents, until she's finally burned and defeated with Pooja's help, as the remaining family flee, bloody and injured. Nimmi comes out of the building at a low angle, then introduces herself as Shabbu to the neighborhood children.

The music of Love Breakups Zindagi was launched on 3 September 2011. The music is composed by the duo Salim–Sulaiman and the lyrics are penned by Javed Akhtar . The album received mostly positive reviews from critics. Sheetal Tiwari of Bollyspice awarded 3 stars saying, ""All in Love, Love Breakups Zindagi , practices what it preaches in that it has songs of love, life and all that lies in between. 'Rab Rakha' and 'Chhayee Hai Tanhayee' are obviously come out on top while 'Love Love Love' and 'Rozaana' are close runners-up. In any event, there is something to be loved about each track from the soundtrack and the merchant brothers continue to remind us why they are considered as one of the best music duos of the current era.""

The album also included a remix of the song ""Main Se Meena Se"" from the 1987 film Khudgarz , sung by Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal .

Love Breakups Zindagi received mixed reviews upon release. Preeti Arora from Rediff.com gave it 2 out of 5 stars, calling it predictable. [ 5 ] Gaurav Malani of The Times of India lamented the fact that director Sahil Singha doesn't show any innovation in the storytelling of his debut venture. [ 6 ] Writing for CNN-IBN , Rajeev Masand gave the film 2 out of 5 stars writing ""Love Breakups Zindagi' is an inoffensive film that has pleasant music and neat production design. First-timer Sahil Sangha directs with an easy hand, giving the film a light-hearted feel. Alas, he's working from a script that offers nothing new or exciting to chew on. I'm going with two out of five for 'Love Breakups Zindagi'. It's a tiring retread of a once popular formula that's wearing thin now."" [ 7 ]

DNA 's Akansha Naval-Shetye and  Soumyadipta Banerjee gave the film positive review saying ""The director has taken a good decision by not putting an airport chase sequence in the film and the leading pair saying ‘I love you’ as they miss their flight.

Mercury (film),tt7881558,"Five long-term friends, who are suffering from mercury poisoning , meet at a farm for a high-school reunion. Michael plans to propose to Meera, and calls her and his friends, and they go on a night-time drive. At their destination, Michael proposes to Meera and she accepts. Afterwards, while driving her four friends home, Meera is temporarily blinded and nearly runs over a dog because the four friends have been interfering with the car's headlights. Somehow, the friends have accidentally dragged a blind man to his death when they swerved to avoid his dog. After dumping the blind man's body, the friends are terrorised by his ghost. The ghost kills the men in the group and tries to kill Meera as well. Meera reveals she is deaf and did not realise the car had hit someone. The ghost realises that he has killed innocent people, thinking they were the owners of a factory whose owners are responsible for the mercury poisoning. The ghost shares his story of being blinded due to mercury poisoning: one night, he was walking his dog when the leash accidentally got stuck to the friends' car and the blind man was dragged along with it until he hit a headstone and died. Despite his accidental death, the ghost forgives Meera and spares her, after possessing her to see his wife one last time. Upon leaving her body, the ghost gives his hearing capacity to Meera and burns down the factory.

Karthik Subbaraj wanted to develop a full-length, dialogue-less feature film after his earlier short film Black and White , which is largely devoid of dialogue. Before the release of his feature directorial debut Pizza (2012), Karthik, an admirer of the silent films of Charlie Chaplin and the dialogue-less film Pushpaka Vimana (1987), had this desire, but found difficulty conceiving a story concept. After completing some feature films, Karthik developed a fictional story set against the backdrop of the 2001 Kodaikanal mercury poisoning incident, in which hundreds of workers were allegedly exposed to toxic mercury vapours at the now-defunct Hindustan Lever factory in Kodaikanal , Tamil Nadu ; the incident also inspired the title Mercury . Karthik stated the film also explores exploitation of small towns by corporations. [ 1 ] He said the absence of dialogue gave him more freedom to emphasise the film's other aspects, such as music, to increase its ""thrill factor"". [ 2 ] Mercury was produced by Kaarthekeyen Santhanam of Stone Bench Creations and Jayantilal Gada of Pen Studios . [ 3 ] Cinematography was handled by Tirru , [ 4 ] the film was edited by Vivek Harshan , and stunts were choreographed by the twin brothers Anbariv . [ 5 ]

Prabhu Deva called his role in Mercury unique and unusual compared with his previous films, where the script demanded a dance or comedy sequence. [ 6 ] The other cast members Sananth , Deepak Paramesh , Indhuja Ravichandran , and Anish Padmanabhan had appeared in Karthik's earlier films. Shashank Purushotham, a Bengaluru -based theatre actor, made his Tamil cinema debut. The actors began rehearsing for their roles 20–25 days before production began. [ 7 ] Remya Nambeesan joined the cast near the end of filming. [ 8 ]

By early June 2017, the makers had completed shooting 60% of the film, mostly at locations in Chennai, Pondicherry, and Kumbakonam . [ 9 ] The film, which was being shot secretly, was officially announced later that month after filming had ended. [ 10 ] Because most of the filming was done indoors, Tirru chose not to keep the camera steady to avoid visual fatigue , either from the characters' points of view of that of a third person. The team also filmed a long take because filming multiple takes would require them to keep moving the cameras. Tirru said: ""The situation too warranted it as cutting it into different shots wouldn't convey the intensity of the scene. The idea was to make the audience understand the characters' stand and make them feel claustrophobic."" [ 11 ]

Santhosh Narayanan , Karthik's regular composer, composed the background music for Mercury . Though the film does not feature any songs, a promotional song titled ""The Mercury Song"" was composed by Mithoon ; lyrics were by Sayeed Quadri , and sung by Haricharan and Gajendra Verma , and the song was released on 15 March 2018. [ 12 ] Santhosh composed another promotional song called ""Oru Mara Nizhalil"", which was recorded by Sathyaprakash Dharmar and lyrics were written by Vivek . ""Oru Mara Nizhalil"", which was released on 19 April 2018, is a montage song that is picturised on the romance between the characters Michael (Sananth) and Meera (Indhuja). [ 13 ] [ 14 ]

Karthik initially tweeted Mercury would be scheduled for theatrical release on 13 April 2018, [ 15 ] which was Friday the 13th . [ 16 ] The film's theatrical trailer was launched on 7 March 2018 and drew a positive response from viewers and audiences. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Because Mercury has no dialogue, the producers found distributing and releasing the film in different regions under the same title was easy. [ 19 ]

Rakshit Shetty 's Paramvah Studios and Pushkar Films distributed Mercury in Karnataka , [ 20 ] and KFC Entertainment acquired the rights to release the film in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana . Pen India Limited acquired the film's global rights. [ 3 ] The trailer of Mercury was scheduled for release on 5 April but to show solidarity with the statewide bandh due to the Kaveri River water dispute , the makers postponed the trailer launch, [ 21 ] although it was launched on 10 April by prominent celebrities. [ 22 ]

Mercury was released worldwide on 13 April 2018, excluding Tamil Nadu , [ 19 ] where a strike was organised by the Tamil Film Producers Council against the digital service providers because of an increase in the Virtual Print Fee . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] A day before the film's official release date in India, Mercury was screened at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The same day, the makers hosted a special screening in Mumbai. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]

Mercury was leaked online through pirate sites, despite not having a scheduled release in Tamil Nadu. Prabhu Deva and the film's cast urged fans not to watch pirated versions. [ 29 ] Mercury became the first Tamil cinema release after the 48-day strike held by Producer's Council. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The film opened to a wide release in Tamil Nadu on 20 April 2018. [ 32 ] Celebrities such as Venkat Prabhu and Rajinikanth praised the film's cast and crew. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]

Mercury received mixed reviews from critics. [ 35 ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 67% of 12 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10. [ 36 ]

The Times of India 's chief critic Reza Noorani gave Mercury three stars out of five, saying: ""There are no big scares that Mercury delivers. Instead, it unravels at its own pace which is not perfect at all times."" [ 37 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV , stated the film is ""a disjointed drama that uses conventions of the slasher flick and the horror film in order to spin a none-too-scary yarn that oftentimes borders on the unintentionally funny""; Chatterjee also stated: ""the film ventures into the territory that A Quiet Place occupies – the destructive force in Mercury turns out to be a figure that waits for the stimuli of sound to line up and pounce on its targets"". [ 38 ] Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu stated the film has its fair share of ""chills"" and ""thrills"". [ 39 ] Udita Jhunjhunwala of Firstpost noted the story as one of the film's major flaws, stating: ""the story just does not stitch together"". [ 40 ]

Anisha Javeri of IndieWire said, ""Though the historical backdrop could have made for a compelling metaphor, the clichés and heavy-handedness of Mercury ultimately outweigh the novelty of its premise, while its sloppy social relevance angle does more to confound than clarify the disaster in question"". She added that it ""may be remembered as the first silent thriller in Indian cinema, but it's far from the heart-stopper we're looking for"". [ 41 ] Manoj Kumar R. of The Indian Express gave three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating: ""Karthik Subbaraj's plot has a few gaps and he also uses the regular narrative techniques of the horror genre to create the moments of shock. However, the overall impact of Mercury on a viewer is very effective, encouraging us to brush aside the shortcomings."" [ 42 ] Sajin Srijith of The New Indian Express gave a rating of four out of five and said: ""Karthik Subbaraj's Mercury is audacious, technically-impressive, and an experiment filled with delightful surprises"". [ 43 ]

Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote: ""Subbaraj tries to dress up a routine horror film with a social theme, but fortunately, the director has enough tricks up his sleeve to make the scary portions work"". [ 44 ] Arnab Bannerjee of Deccan Chronicle gave Mercury one-and-a-half five stars and stated: ""Karthik Subbaraj tries to juggle a thriller horror story with a not-so-original twist"". [ 45 ] According to Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion , Karthik made both a thriller and an ""emotional horror-drama with a touch of eco-activism"". [ 46 ] Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute stated: ""The film breaks out of the formula horror film and attempts something new although the characters don't stand out"".

Rangoon (2017 Hindi film),tt4909752,"In 1943, as the Second World War rages on, India is fighting a war of her own: independence from British rule . Subash Chandra Bose , founder of the Indian National Army (INA), has become disenchanted with Mahatma Gandhi 's Ahimsa (non-violent) movement and desires to fight fire with fire. Indian troops in the British Indian Army are locked in pitched battles with both the INA and its Japanese contingent. In one such skirmish close to the Indo-Burma border , Jemadar Nawab Malik and a group of fellow soldiers are cornered by the Japanese infantry. Running to escape on a barge, Nawab is shot and captured as a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, the INA's top brass desperately seeks finances to replenish its heavy ammunition to aid the charge to Delhi.

Simultaneously, in India, Julia, a leading film star, is the star performer in a dance troupe that entertains civilians and armed forces. Zulfi is her butler, makeup man, and trusted confidant. Her films are produced by Rustom ""Rusi"" Billimoria, a former Indian action film star whose career was cut short when he lost a hand in a film stunt gone wrong. Billimoria is on friendly terms with the resident British commander, Major General David Harding, who encounters a gem-encrusted royal sword belonging to a Maharajah at a gathering hosted by Billimoria. Slighted by the commander's arrogant demeanor, the King endeavours to send the sword to the Indo-Burma border, where the INA hopes it can fund its artillery program and drive the British out of India. An opportunity arises when Harding proposes dispatching Julia and her troupe to the war-torn border, where he hopes to raise the sagging morale of his troops through her shows. When Billimoria and Julia (who are now in a relationship) object, Harding promises top-grade security and coerces them by threatening to block supplies of film stock from England, as Nazi Germany has stopped shipments. Billimoria's affair with Julia causes rifts in his family, with his wife demanding a divorce and his grandfather concocting a ruse to prevent Billimoria accompanying Julia on the tour.

On board the train, Jemadar Malik, who has apparently escaped as a prisoner of war, is assigned as a security detail to Julia, much to her chagrin. Crossing a river, the full complement of passengers and boatmen come under fierce Japanese aerial attack, resulting in numerous casualties. The British assume Julia has fallen, but she has survived and is accosted by three Japanese soldiers. Malik, who has also escaped unscathed, arrives in time to save her from being killed and, in the process, captures one Japanese soldier, Hiromichi, as a hostage to lead them back to the Indian border. Through the rain-drenched jungle and a war zone swarming with enemy platoons, Julia, Malik, and Hiromichi march slowly to their destination. Combing an anti-aircraft bunker, they barely escape a booby trap, with Malik furious at Hiromichi for leading them into an ambush. As Julia's gentleness and compassion counteract Malik's battle-hardened cynicism and aggression, the two fall in love.

Back in India, Harding again proposes that Julia, now engaged to Billimoria, be dispatched to the front lines, with anti-aircraft gun protection this time. Julia continues to exhibit feelings for Malik: she endorses him for the prestigious Victoria Cross medal and deliberately forces him to volunteer for a stage show. Billimoria begins to have suspicions about her behaviour, which are confirmed after one surreptitious and passionate episode between Malik and Julia during an air raid. Desiring vengeance, Billimoria volunteers as a stagehand on Julia's next show and, after a tense routine, indirectly reveals that he is aware of her infidelity and ready to engage in a fight-to-the-finish with Malik. Meanwhile, Zulfi, who has also survived the earlier raid and is in reality a spy for the INA, has been entrusted to take the sword back to the INA by Mema, an INA agent in the British ranks, and Malik. It is then revealed that Malik did not escape his captivity in Rangoon but was freed by the INA, who enlightened him about the evils of British rule in India, thereby enlisting him in the Gandhi regiment of the INA. Convinced of the cause and endowed with a fresh purpose, Malik clandestinely meets Julia before a show and delivers final instructions to Zulfi, who takes up a position outside her tent. Major Williams racially insults Zulfi after trying to forcibly enter Julia's tent to make her begin the show. Infuriated and inebriated, Zulfi hurls derogatory threats to the British on the radio during Julia's show. The outburst is heard by Billimoria, Harding, and other British soldiers, who rush to uncover the offensive culprit. Zulfi pleads guilty in Julia's presence on the stage but is shot dead by Williams, while Harding discovers Zulfi possessed a British Army officer's pistol. Distraught, Julia protests Billimoria's decision to not give Zulfi a proper burial as another member of Julia's troupe covertly abets Malik in a show of weapon check. As night falls amid torrential downpour, Julia and Malik give Zulfi a proper burial, musing over loyalties and motivations.

During an attempt to arrange a rendezvous for transferring the sword with the INA via a letter, Malik and Mema are caught by Julia, who accuses Malik of betrayal. Torn between his feelings for her and his cause, Malik retorts by saying Julia is blinded by what she sees and the truth is lost on her. The letter reaches the INA, but Mema is trapped by the British while relaying messages. The next day, Harding blackmails Mema into revealing her co-conspirators by threatening to kill her son, at which point Malik discloses his true allegiance. Singing the INA anthem, Malik marches up defiantly to Harding, who signals Williams to shoot Mema dead. Enraged at this callous attitude, Malik lunges at Williams but is captured and tortured by his former comrades. Horrified at this sequence of events, Julia turns a new leaf: she extracts Malik from a train bound for Delhi and resumes Zulfi's journey in getting the sword to the INA. At the bridge where the sword is to be handed over, Malik and Julia are cornered by the British. Malik convinces Julia to cross the bridge by covering her. In the ensuing gunfight, Malik is seriously injured by mortar fire while Billimoria arrives with British reinforcements. Harding tries to dissuade Julia from crossing the bridge with another false promise, but the mortally wounded Malik defies him by walking across the bridge and sacrifices his own life so that Julia can continue. Harding orders the bridge be blown up, causing grave injuries to Julia. Seeking to redeem himself, Billimoria asks Julia for her last wish, who appeals that he continue her task of delivering the sword to the INA before falling to her death. Unsheathing the shining sword, Billimoria massacres the rest of the British troops on the bridge, decapitates Harding, and walking on the rope delivers the sword to the INA. The film ends by proclaiming the INA raised the Indian flag in 1944.

Vishal Bhardwaj was supposed to shoot the film after Omkara (2006). [ 15 ] However, the film was stalled for unknown reasons. It was previously titled Julia . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The screenplay was written by Matthew Robbins , who previously collaborated for 7 Khoon Maaf (2011). [ 18 ] [ 19 ]

The film's shooting began on 18 November 2015 in Arunachal Pradesh . [ 20 ] Many artists from Manipur , Arunachal joined the crew for the first shift. In mid January, the film's shooting was halted due to an injury to Shahid Kapoor and a Japanese actor. [ 21 ] Kangana Ranaut travelled to New York City to research her role, [ 22 ] and then headed to an island in Mexico to learn solo living. [ 23 ]

The film was released on 24 February 2017. [ 11 ] Upon its release, the film received positive reviews, although Kangana Ranaut 's performance as Julia was widely praised as the strength of the film. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The film failed to find a wider audience and was one of the biggest flops of 2017. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The film is also available on Netflix . [ 31 ]

Upon release, Rangoon received positive reviews from the film critics, with major praise drawn to Ranaut's performance. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds a rating of 55% based on 11 reviews and an average rating of 6.1/10. [ 32 ]

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Rangoon is an epic love saga with strong strong emotional quotient, riveting second hour and nail-biting finale. Watch it for its layered plot, serpentine twists, proficient storytelling and bravura performances, its a content-driven film that's worth a recommendation’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, ‘‘Kangana portrays the lifeline of Rusi and Nawab with commanding authority; She owns every sequence she appears in, she makes every moment come alive with a memorable act. What's noteworthy is that Kangana is effortless and stands tall in the most challenging sequences’’. [ 33 ] Raja Sen from Rediff gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Rangoon haunts in unlikely fashion and, while the director's most straightforward picture, holds enough of its own marvels to justify multiple viewings’’. Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, ‘‘Kangana Ranaut is extraordinary as she rides and throws and dances with aplomb in what is physically an immensely demanding part. Ranaut looks like she knows how to actually crack a whip instead of just hurl one around, and acquits herself admirably in old-world stuntwoman sequences, all the while playing the part with enough vulnerability and insecurity to mark Julia out as a confused girl who doesn't quite know what she's doing’’. [ 34 ] Devarsi Ghosh of India Today gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Rangoon is gorgeous-looking film with great cinematography, fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography’’. [ 35 ]

Ujala Ali Khan from The National gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, ‘‘The breathtaking cinematography and attention to detail in the film are remarkable; Cinematographer Panjak Kumar does a great job of delivering a believable peak into the past, and the leading trio slip effortlessly into their roles’’. Praising Ranaut's performance she further wrote, ‘‘The standout star is without a doubt Ranaut who does complete justice to Julia and, just like Fearless Nadia , takes your breath away with her stunts; Queen Kangana proves that she is here to stay’’. [ 25 ] Mike McCahill from The Guardian gave the film a rating of 4/5 and called it a ‘‘sweeping second world war epic that describes a collision of worlds’’. He further wrote, ‘‘they've produced a properly expansive and enthralling afternoon matinee, owing as much to the David Lean back catalogue as it does to the industry that gifted us Lagaan – and those films didn't have dance numbers about winding up Hitler ’’. [ 36 ] Meena Iyer from Times of India gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote, ‘‘ Rangoon is an ambitious attempt to actually tell a triangular love story against the backdrop of war, the canvas is huge and Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is exquisite’’. Praising the performances of lead actors she further wrote, ‘‘Saif gives his movie-entrepreneur act a razor-sharp quality. And, Shahid is outstanding. Kangana of course is the piece de resistance ’’. [ 37 ] Anupriya Kumar of Reuters wrote, ‘‘Bhardwaj ensure solid performances from his lead cast and topped it with clever execution’’. Praising Ranaut's performance she further wrote, ‘‘Ranaut displays a wide array of moods and emotions and is convincingly vain and generous, manipulative and gullible, brave and frightened’’. [ 38 ]

Simon Abrams from RogerEbert.com gave the film a rating of three out of four stars and wrote, ""The most remarkable thing about Rangoon isn't how seamless its plot mechanics are or how ideologically nuanced it is; it's the movie's determination to foreground its characters and get you to care what happens to them"". [ 39 ] Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 2/5 and criticised the writing and the script of the film. He praised Ranaut's performance by calling her the ‘‘Saving grace of Rangoon ’’ and wrote, ‘‘Everything boils down to Kangana Ranaut's Julia and her antics. She is undoubtedly a rock solid performer, because if there is one actor who shines despite odd writing, it's her. She is terrific as a theatrics-loving stuntwoman. The poor script never lets Julia reach her pinnacle but she steals the show even with small scenes’’. [ 40 ] Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 1.5/5 and described it as a ‘‘patchy film’’. She praised Ranaut's performance by stating, ‘‘Kangana Ranaut delivers a standout performance in this patchy film; Her body language is spot on, and some of her action sequences are thrilling, even if you can see the computer graphics a mile off. And she gets one spectacular speaking moment, the camera tight on her face, when she speaks of love and desire and heartbreak’’. [ 24 ]

NDTV ranked Ranaut as the 2nd Best Actress of the year 2017 for her performance in Rangoon . [ 41 ]

Music for the film was composed by Vishal Bhardwaj , with lyrics by Gulzar . The first song titled ""Bloody Hell"" [ 42 ] was released on 11 January 2017, along with the music video.

Shagird (2011 film),tt1828289,"The film opens with gangster Bunty Bhaiya being arrested in Ghaziabad . In Delhi, Mohit Kumar is about to join the crime branch as a sub-inspector under senior inspector Hanumant Singh. There he meets Singh’s team, which is taking bribes from a builder and their commission from the land mafia lord, who is threatening the builder’s life.

Meanwhile, Hanumant Singh visits land mafia lord Choudhary as a landowner from Rajasthan and kills Chaudhary and his gang. Two of the remaining gang members escape and hide in a house. Reporter Varsha Mathur from the Aaj Tak news channel to cover the incident. Hanumant takes their media camera and, using his wit, gets the goons to open the door and shoots them. Later, he tells the media that both were wanted, terrorists. On the other side of the city, a person comes and threatens Hanumant’s wife of killing Hanumant and his whole family if he doesn’t stop doing his mischievous activities. At one point gunshots are fired on his house, and Hanumant tells his wife to leave India as soon as she gets her passport.

Bunty Bhaiya has been transferred to Delhi jail, where he is treated as a high-profile personality by the jailer. In jail, Bunty befriends two terrorists of Lashkar-e-Haq. Hanumant takes Mohit to Rajmani’s (politician) birthday. There Rajmani tells him to encounter Ali tonight at his birthday party.

Before encountering Ali, he tells Hanumant of the drug deal going to take place, which Hanumant sabotages and takes money and drugs with him. In the drug deal encounter, Mohit saves Hanumant's life in the nick of time. Later, Hanumant sends his wife and son to New Zealand for their own safety. In the meantime, three journalists are kidnapped by a terrorist who asks for the release of their mates and Bunty Bhaiya from Tihar jail.

When the government releases the three, Hanumant kills the two terrorists and takes Bunty into his safe house. It was later revealed that Hanumant was actually behind the kidnapping. Meanwhile, Mohit tips Hanumant about their colleague Shamsher Rana trying to kill him on instructions of Rajmani. Alert, Hanumant, in turn, kills Shamsher, faking it as a suicide case. Then Hanumant demands 15 crore from Rajmani for his release; else he will post the video of Bunty's confessions to the media.

Hanumant is shot down, where Mohit shows his presence of mind and admits him to the hospital. In the hospital, Hanumant realizes that Mohit was all along working for Rajamani. Even though Mohit is planning to eliminate Hanumant, he agrees to share his ransom money for Mohit to save his life during the drug deal encounter, which is a genuine attempt, unlike the other attempts made to gain his confidence. Then both of them chalk out a plan to make money from Rajmani.

After increasing the deal from 15 to 25 crore by sending a video recording of Bunty with Mohit in the video (which he wasn't aware of), Rajmani agreed on the deal and gave Mohit the money. Mohit shows up at the place as directed by Hanumant and drives off to meet him. In the end, Hanumant and Mohit divide their share of the money and part ways, not knowing there is a transponder in the case. Hanumant had some children call Rajmani Bunty's location, and they rush off to the location. Upon entering Rajmani's car, Bunty was shot dead by Rajmani, and they continued to the parliament. Not realising the reporters are watching, Rajmani is captured by the police in a roadblock when they saw Bunty's dead body in the car.

Mohit is killed by Rajmani's people in a car chase, in which he kills them all too. Hanumant goes to send the money to his family through Kamlesh ( Veerendra Saxena ), who does money transfers for him, but is shockingly shot twice by Kamlesh. Kamlesh tells him that he also has a family to feed and that he has never seen such a big amount in his whole life, and that has made him disloyal. Kamlesh dials a number; it is shown that Mohit's cellphone is ringing unattended beside his corpse , implying Mohit arranged the plot, and Kamlesh walks away.

Union Leader (film),tt6395306,"Jay Gohil (Bhat) is employed as supervisor at a chromium sulfate factory of Apollo Chemicals in Gujarat. The workers there are experiencing deteriorating health conditions; respiratory diseases and cancers and five eventually succumb to their illness, all because of the poor working conditions at the factory. Leader of their union is in cahoots with the factory management and turns a blind eye to their problems. Reluctantly Jay becomes the voice of his colleagues and demands wage hike and medical insurance . Angered by the workers' demands, factory owner decides to shut it down.

Jay's son Harsh (Tirth Sharma) believes in Gandhism and plays a key role in raising the workers' issues.

Patel had worked as chemical engineer in Gujarat before moving to Canada. He based the film on his observations of the workers in chemical factories in Gujarat. The project began under the title Kamdar Union and marked Patel's maiden attempt at making a full-length feature film. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Costumes worn by actors in the film were bought from a local market and were ""age[d]"" using ""herbal colours and other products"" in 11–12 days each. [ 1 ]

The filming took place at Vatva , Ahmedabad and other places in Gujarat and it was wrapped up towards the end of December 2016. Patel cast Indian actors for his film and managed the finances himself. However, the post-production work was done in Calgary , Canada and the film's title was changed to Union Leader . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]

The film was released in theatres on 19 January 2018. [ 3 ] A special screening of the film was held at the Suncor Energy Centre , Fort McMurray in November 2017. [ 4 ]

Though critical of the film, Anna MM Vetticad in her review for Firstpost praised Bhat's performance and gave the film a 1.5/5 rating. He opined that the film's ""[commitment] to its cause"" was its strength and that Bhat had brought an ""X factor to his performance"" which exceeded the screenplay's limitations. He, however, felt that the supporting characters had not been used ""effectively"" which robbed the film of its ""emotional stirrings"". [ 5 ] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in was appreciative of the film's ""sympathetic portrayal of the workers"", noting that the ""convincing cast of supporting actors ... actually look like blue-collared representatives rather than Bollywood extras"". She wrote that the remaining cast ""works better"" than Bhat who was ""passable"". [ 6 ]

Pallabi Dey Purkayastha of The Times of India gave the film a 2.5/5 rating, noting that although the film showed ""pragmatism"" but ""crumbles towards the end because of poor execution"". [ 7 ] Ravi Bule of Amar Ujala wrote that Shome did justice to her role, while rating the film 2/5.

Rukh received mostly positive reviews.

Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, ""Rukh has its own narrative technique. To categorise Rukh as an art-house film would be an injustice to Atanu Mukherjee's talent. It's a ‘different’ film, for the want of a better word."" [ 5 ]

Rajeev Masand also gave the movie 3 out of stars and stated, ""Despite the overwhelming heaviness, and frankly a cop-out ending, the film is powered by its performances. Bajpayee and Tambe both have a melancholic stillness, while Gourav conveys angst and grief through restlessness."" [ 9 ]

Namrata Joshi of The Hindu called it ""a meandering and monotonous feature film"". [ 10 ]

Anupama Chopra gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated that the film is intermittently engaging yet never seems essential. [ 11 ]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Rukh_-_Movie_Poster.jpg/220px-Rukh_-_Movie_Poster.jpg
Mukkabaaz,tt7180544,"Shravan Singh is a struggling boxer who works for a local politician and head of the State Boxing Federation, Bhagwan Das Mishra. He drifts away after Mishra has him perform only domestic tasks and errands rather than training him in boxing. Singh falls in love with Mishra's niece, Sunaina, who is a mute. Her father tells him to get a job before considering marrying her. For the job, Singh tries to enter the state-level tournament but is not selected because of Mishra. He then leaves for Varanasi and is trained by a local trainer, Sanjay Kumar.

Singh defeats Mishra's boxer and wins a medal, after which he gets a job with the Indian Railways . Singh and Sunaina are married as her father promised. However, Mishra despises the marriage and threatens his brother. Singh tries to balance his job, training, family life and learning sign language at Sunaina's request. Meanwhile, his boss at the office tries to harass him by putting too much work pressure on him. Mishra gets Sunaina's father fired from his job and expels her family from their home. They go to their ancestral village to live but are held captive by Mishra's goons in his village house. Mishra also breaks his brother's leg.

Later, at Sanjay Kumar's house, both Kumar and Singh are attacked by a mob after being falsely accused of eating beef. Kumar gets seriously injured in the attack and is admitted to an ICU ; Singh survives the attack. He then tries to find Sunaina but fails; meanwhile, she is forcefully engaged to a businessman with a disability, by Mishra for money. Singh fights and qualifies for the final of a national tournament. Sunaina and her mother manage to call Singh and tell him of their whereabouts. Singh goes there and rescues Sunaina and her family. Mishra manages to disqualify Singh on health grounds but reinstates him after Singh apologizes; Mishra also requires that Singh lose the match and retire from boxing. Thus, Singh loses the final match.

Actor Vineet Kumar Singh said that he was not getting the kind of work he wanted in films, so he decided to write his own script on boxing, as he has an athletic background, having been a national-level basketball player who played at six National Games at the mini and sub-junior levels. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The idea of the film came to Singh based on his observation of the experiences of athletes in the country. He said: ""I’ve seen lots of stories like this, which stayed with me over the years. I wrote this film because I wanted to play this character and I knew the only way to do that is by writing it myself."" [ 4 ] Singh wrote the script with his sister, basketball player Mukti Singh Srinet, in 2013 and sought a financier for it. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He looked at the ""player's struggles — those who couldn't find their way up because they couldn't land in the officials' good books; the bad conditions they lived, played and practised in"". [ 5 ] He mentioned a single incident that triggered the script was seeing his senior, who had won several boxing medals and whose photographs had appeared in the newspaper, ""stealthily porting luggage"" at the Varanasi Junction railway station to make ends meet. [ 5 ] [ 3 ] When Singh saw him, he was trying to hide his face behind the luggage. Singh said the incident ""really shook"" him because he was also a sportsperson. He took inspiration from the story of some other players who worked as a sweeper or who sold their medals. [ 3 ]

While he was pitching his script, Singh also worked on his stamina for the role by running, skipping and cardio training for two hours every day. [ 3 ] Singh insisted that he had to be the lead actor of the film, but no producer would agree to this. [ 8 ] Eventually, director Anurag Kashyap learned of the script. He had worked earlier with Singh on three films: Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), Bombay Talkies (2013) and Ugly (2014). [ 4 ] Kashyap felt that the script was very similar to Rocky (1976) and asked Singh to show him a ""Rocky"" in India. [ 6 ] However, Kashyap found one sequence in the script where the protagonist tries to get a government job interesting. [ 6 ] He said he would make the film on two conditions: he would change the script a little, and Singh needed ""to look like a boxer"". [ 3 ]

For Kashyap, it was boxing and the case of Narsingh Pancham Yadav , who was accused of doping , that prompted him to make the film. [ 6 ] Singh said that he knew about the ""politics, caste bias and power struggles in sports associations"" but Kashyap developed the sociopolitical side of the script. [ 9 ] To prepare for the role, Singh could find only mixed martial arts fighters in Mumbai, who were expensive. Kashyap connected him to boxer Vijender Singh , who put him in touch with coaches in Patiala. [ 3 ] Singh sold all his belongings and left Mumbai the same night for training after Kashyap decided to make the film. [ 9 ]

Kashyap, Singh, Mukti Singh, K.D.Satyam , Ranjan Chandel and Prasoon Mishra wrote the final script. [ 10 ] Anand L. Rai called Kashyap and asked him to direct Manmarziyaan , but Kashyap said he wanted to make Mukkabaaz first. They both agreed to this and decided to co-produce the film. [ 11 ] In July 2017, it was confirmed they would be working together on the film. [ 12 ] The film is set in the Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh and is inspired by several true incidents. [ 7 ] Mukkabaaz also deals with the issue of the caste system and cow vigilantism in India. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Singh trained for a year to play the part with coach Anudeep Singh, a former boxer, who was coaching people for free and runs a garage. His story was used when researching the film. [ 15 ] He was also trained by Harpreet Singh, who was a coach of the Indian boxing team. [ 16 ] Singh did not disclose to his coaches that he was preparing for a film role. [ 8 ] His trainers said that Singh was learning boxing at the age when boxers usually retire. [ 16 ] Singh's training began at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports , Patiala , a year before filming. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] During training, he could not see punches coming and took a real beating every day, at one point breaking some ribs. Later, he learned how to counter and defend himself. He trained for more than 700 days and was injured several times. [ 16 ]

Delhi theatre actress Zoya Hussain makes her feature debut in the film playing a mute girl. [ 17 ] Kashyap had wanted to work with her after seeing her film Three and Half Takes , which he liked. [ 18 ] To prepare for the role, Hussain spent several months learning non-verbal language and mannerisms from sign language expert Sangeeta Gala. [ 4 ] Kashyap said that her disability symbolises the lack of voice women in her region have. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]

Ravi Kishan plays the role of Sanjay Kumar, a failed boxer who teaches Shravan Kumar boxing. He was selected by casting director Mukesh Chhabra . [ 19 ] Rajesh Tailang plays the role of Shravan's father. [ 20 ] Jimmy Shergill was cast as the antagonist, Bhagwan Das Mishra, an upper-caste don . [ 21 ] Sadhana Singh was also part of the film. [ 22 ] Real life boxers Neeraj Goyat and Deepak Tanwar also appear in the film. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]

Kashyap sent his second unit director, Saqib Pandor, to record boxing tournaments, which were then recreated as the state tournaments for the film. [ 6 ] They witnessed a boxing tournament happening under a tent without an audience as the boxing ring was being used for something else. [ 6 ] Kashyap also realised that after attending an actual boxing tournament in north India that there was no audience apart from ""people in power who decide which boxer should represent the state, and who will not"". [ 15 ] Kashyap told Singh not to do "" filmi training"" but to become a hardcore boxer. [ 25 ] [ 6 ] No boxing choreographers or action directors were used for the film. [ 6 ] Kashyap also watched several Hollywood films about boxing. [ 26 ] During filming, he fought with real international-level boxers with no choreography. He broke a rib and his hand. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Kashyap said that in sports films the actors ""expose themselves too much"", whereas Singh ""just disappeared"" into the role. [ 5 ] Mukkabaaz was shot in Bareilly , Varanasi and Lucknow in May 2017. [ 8 ] [ 27 ]

The film was singer-composer Rachita Arora 's first film as a composer. She was recommended to Kashyap by Makrand Deshpande . She was doing a play with him and was standing outside in a parking lot. Kashyap heard a song composed by Arora and approached her, later signing her for the film. [ 6 ] Aarti Bajaj and Ankit Bidyadhar edited the film, while Shanker Raman, Rajeev Ravi and Jayesh Nair served as the directors of photography . [ 10 ]

The film's soundtrack featured ten tracks; eight songs and two alternates. Rachita Arora composed seven tracks for the album, with one song ""Paintra"" and its extended version, being composed by Nucleya and ""Adhura Main"" by Vineet Kumar Singh . Lyrics for the songs were written by Singh, Hussain Haidry and Sunil Jogi . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The soundtrack was released on 23 December 2017 under the Eros Music label. [ 30 ]

Mukkabaaz premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and was also screened at the 2017 MAMI Film Festival , where it received a standing ovation. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] The film was originally scheduled for release on 10 November 2017, but the date moved to 12 January 2018. [ 12 ] [ 21 ] Mukkabaaz was released alongside Kaalakaandi and 1921 on about 1100 screens across India. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] A special screening was held for the cast and crew before the theatrical release. [ 35 ] The film is also available in DVD format and in the online streaming platform, Zee5 . [ 36 ] [ 37 ]

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 88% of 16 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10. [ 38 ]

Mukkabaaz received mostly positive reviews from critics with particular praise for Singh's performance. [ 39 ] Rajeev Masand responded positively saying, ""[..] populated by characters that are authentic and rooted firmly in the landscape, the film sees Kashyap on solid ground."" He felt, however, the film was ""overlong and occasionally rambling"". [ 40 ] Anirudh Bhattacharya of Outlook felt the film was a ""little heftier"" but said, ""this isn't Raging Bull , it's just rocky."" [ 41 ] Raja Sen called it Kashyap's best film, made with ""vintage filmi sensibility but highly modern skills"". He also praised Singh for a ""tremendous performance, not least because of his staggeringly authentic physicality"". [ 42 ] The Hindustan Times ' Rohit Vats commended both Hussain's and Singh's performances. He noted that though Hussain is ""at the lack of words"" ... ""her eyes are not"", and praising Singh for giving a ""performance we all will cherish for years"". Vats also called it ""the best film in last one year or so."" (sic) [ 43 ]

Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India cited the film as a ""total knockout"" and wrote: ""The not-just-a-boxing film must not be missed as it puts forth a message that's most relevant in today's world."" [ 44 ] The Hindu ' s Namrata Joshi wrote: ""This is in no way a celebration of sports but a hard-nosed look at the rampant corruption, nepotism and casteist politics at the core of games, and life in general, especially their centrality in Uttar Pradesh."" [ 45 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV praised Hussain and Zoya 's performances and the treatment of cow vigilantism and wrote: ""Watch it because it is one of the more important films to have come out of the Mumbai movie industry in recent times."" [ 46 ]

Anupama Chopra praised Singh's physical transformation as well as the ""internal transformation"", though she expressed her concern over the film's runtime that ""just wears you down"". [ 47 ] Mayank Shekhar wrote: "" Mukkabaaz marks Kashyap's fab return to a realm he understands and expresses best -- with all its flaws, angst and humour, Tarantino-esque pop-culture references, making it all as distressing as it is frickin' fun and real."" [ 48 ] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare felt it was Kashyap's ""most mature film to date"" with ""bits of Rocky , On the Waterfront and a whole lot of Romeo & Juliet "". [ 49 ] Uday Bhatia of Mint called it a ""bracing start to the movie year"" that is ""overstuffed, enjoyable and urgent"". [ 50 ]

On the contrary, Sreehari Nair of Rediff.com felt the film tried to cover too many issues and called it a ""minor Anurag Kashyap film"" that ""aims low and hits."" [ 51 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express said that the ""punches land in exactly the right place"" when caste discrimination is addressed in the film. She also felt that the ""film falters when it slips into melodrama"". [ 52 ] Tanul Thakur of The Wire wrote: "" Mukkabaaz fails to go beyond the surface of caste realities."" [ 53 ] Reuters ' Shilpa Jamkhandikar  said that the film ""tries to land too many punches, and in doing so, misses the mark."" [ 54 ]

Among the overseas reviewers, Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter in a positive review wrote: ""Energetic, cinematic, political and not just for sports fans."" [ 55 ] Screen International 's David D'Archy mentioned in his review: ""Kashyap manages to pack caste inequality, corruption and a triumph over disability into a romantic melodrama built around the boxing ring."" [ 56 ] Wendy Ide called the film an example of ""gritty, grubby film-making"" with ""robustly filthy"" dialogues, the violence ""unflinching and the music loaded with innuendo"". [ 57 ] Mike McCahill of The Guardian called it ""a heavy-hitting social critique disguised as a rock 'em–sock 'em sports movie."" [ 58 ]

Mukkabaaz earned ₹ 82 lakh (US$97,000) in its first day of release and ₹ 1.51 crore (US$180,000) on its second day.

The monomaniacal focus on one man above all else will surely be of interest to those who study how cinema can be used for propaganda"". [ 34 ] Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India gave the film two and a half stars out of five and criticised the script, opining, ""This one is too lopsided for you to appreciate. It leaves a lot unanswered. While it firmly believes ‘Modi ek insaan nahi, soch hai’, we wish the script was as thoughtful"". However, she was among the few who appreciated Oberoi's performance- ""He gets the mannerisms, accent and tone right and thankfully doesn't overdo it"". [ 35 ] Writing for The Indian Express , Shubhra Gupta gave the movie two stars out of five and stated, ""The film is not a mere bio-pic, it is a full-fledged, unabashed, unapologetic hagiography"". [ 36 ] Kennith Rosario of The Hindu summarised the movie's narrative as ""a obsequious love letter"" to the protagonist which tells the audience ""how sincere, hardworking, fair and honest Modi is, [and] that it makes you wonder if life is a parody of this film"". [ 37 ]

The main opposition party of India claimed that the BJP lead government is using bollywood as a propaganda machine and the movie is aimed to serve a perilous mix of high-pitched nationalism and strongman branding of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. [ 38 ] [ 39 ]

The film collected ₹ 2.25-2.5 million nett on its opening day, and was the second best-performing film among all others released in India on that day, after Aladdin (2019).

Kuchh Bheege Alfaaz,tt7617988,"Every night at 10, Kolkata tunes into radio to listen to 'Kuchh Bheege Alfaaz' – an episodic series of unrequited love stories hosted by RJ Alfaz who, despite his tremendous following, prefers staying detached and anonymous. Among his many fans is the boisterous Archana ( Geetanjali Thapa ), a girl working at a creative agency – which designs branded memes. She is leukodermic but lives life to the fullest. They meet; or rather talk, for the first time over a misplaced call when Archana accidentally dials Alfaaz's (Zain Khan Durrani) number, while trying to connect with her latest blind date. Thus begins an interesting relationship between two unlikely characters, one overly compensating, but in denial of her present, and the other buried under a dark secret of his past.

This is Onirs first film which doesn't have an original song. There are three old songs ""Tum Aa Gaye Ho"" (Aandhi), ""Ajeeb Daastan Hai Ye"" (Dil Apna Aur Preet Parayi) & ""Pehla Nasha"" (Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander) which are woven into the narrative.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Kuchh_Bheege_Alfaaz.jpg/220px-Kuchh_Bheege_Alfaaz.jpg
The Xposé,tt3645014,"In 1960s Bombay , two actresses, Zara Fernandes and Chandni Roy, are both set to make their film debut on the same date. Chandni's film Reena Mera Naam becomes a box office success, whereas Zara's film Ujjwal Nirmal Sheetal is a flop . This angers Zara who believes she is higher and better than every other new actress. Zara starts an argument with Chandni after an awards party , and the two end up fighting. Later that night, Zara is murdered. The blame obviously goes towards Chandni, and she has no way to prove her innocence.

Chandni's lover, Ravi Kumar, decides to step in and find the real murderer to save his love. Ravi happens to be an ex-cop, who was sacked from his job as a police officer after shooting a parliamentarian . Ravi is now an actor, who happens to have debuted in the same film as Zara. The suspect list in the murder is extremely large, there is Virmaan, who is Chandni's ex-boyfriend, Subba Prasad who is Zara's film director and KD, a music director who had an affair with Zara, as well as many other suspects.

After Ravi's investigation, it turns out that after Zara and Chandni fought, Zara went up to the terrace where she met KD (hinting that their affair was still going on at the time of her death) and as the two got together, KD's wife Shabnam started looking for KD. KD heard Shabnam coming up to the terrace, so he tried to run away, and accidentally pushed Zara away from him, which led to her falling from the terrace. It also turns out that after falling down, she landed outside Subba Prasad's window. Subba decided to let her fall so her death could gain attention and maybe help their flop film be successful.

KD and Subba are convicted. KD is sentenced to 7 years, and Subba is given a life sentence in prison. After all the supposed suspects leave the court, Chandni confesses her love for Ravi. The two get together, and Ravi tells Chandni that, actually, he knew that she was the one who murdered Zara. In a flashback, it is revealed that after Subba let Zara fall down, she was still alive and was found by Chandni. Chandni was so frustrated and annoyed by her that she hit Zara on the head with a glass bottle, finally killing her.

Angry Indian Goddesses,tt3368222,"Freida is a fashion photographer who invites a group of friends to her family's home to announce her wedding. The group, from all over India, consists of Madhurita or Mad, a Bollywood singer, Pamela Jaswal or Pammy, a trophy wife , Suranjana or Su, a businesswoman, and Joanna or Jo, an aspiring actress. Nargis, an activist, later joins the party. The announcement sets off a chain of reactions, letting out hidden secrets from all of the women. Freida explains that her father will not join her for the wedding, and Mad's boyfriend, who comes looking for her, explains that she is depressed and suicidal. After the announcement, the women  descend upon Goa . Thus begins an impromptu bachelorette party , and they begin to bond.

Everything's set for a night of celebration. There's only one issue: Frieda won't say who her fiance is. As they banter their way through celebration, their conversation, derived entirely from improvisations among the actors, covers everything from sex to street harassment to the buff (and often shirtless) next-door neighbour.

During the trip, the women are harassed and they react boldly. Their harassers are enraged and they are shaken. As the holiday progresses, we become acquainted with the women's dreams, desires, fears and, above all, their unwavering bond with one another.

Later, the women learn that Freida will marry Nargis (which was illegal under the IPC section 377 until 6 September 2018). On the eve of the wedding, the group decides to have a picnic on the beach. At the picnic, a heated argument between Jo and the rest of the group regarding her accent leads Jo to walk out, but the party continues till late into the night. When they decide to go home, they look for Jo. She is found dead on the beach, apparently raped. The doctor, who arrives in the ambulance, refuses to treat her before the police come as she is already dead. The police arrive shortly and the police officer in charge conducts his preliminary inquiries in a manner that shames the women, reiterating their lack of faith in a patriarchal society that treats women shabbily. They return home, distraught and frustrated.

Su's daughter Maya had followed Jo when she left the party and took photos of her. The pictures reveal that it was the group of six men who had harassed the friends earlier that gang raped and killed Jo. Su heads back to the beach with a gun. The rest of the group chases after her. Su shoots 4 of the rapists before Nargis stops her. Mad takes the gun and kills the other two.

At Jo's funeral, the group makes a series of sentimental speeches, Nargis' speech summarizing the worth of a woman and hopes that in the next lives of women, they will be able to write their own stories. The police officer interrupts the ceremony, asking for a confession of guilt from the women and wanting them to stand up. The story has an open-ended conclusion, with the entire congregation in the church standing up in solidarity with the women.

The film's music was composed by Cyril Morin and produced by Super Cassettes Industries Limited. Song lyrics were written by Raman Negi, Anushka Manchanda, and Dr. Swapnil Salkar.

The film's opening title sequence was designed by Plexus, a Mumbai-based VFX and animation studio. The title sequence was named by Artofthetitle.com as one of the top ten title sequences of 2015. [ 4 ] The studio's founders and motion graphics artists Vijesh Rajan and Yashoda Parthasarthy were also interviewed by the Artofthetitle.com staff about their process for designing the title sequence. [ 5 ] The title sequence was asked to be censored and blurred in its entirety by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for its Indian release. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]

The film was released in two versions: an international version, and an Indian version. The international version which was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival is not censored and does not have an interval , unlike the Indian version. [ 8 ]

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 18 critics, with an average rating of 5.9/10. [ 9 ]

Namrata Joshi of The Hindu wrote "" Pavleen Gujral is a revelation and Sarah-Jane Dias shows admirable poise"". [ 10 ]

Mohar Basu of The Times of India said ""Alas, the story is never supported by a solid screenplay. The film's pace is a problem and though things gear up in the second half, it ends as a loopy mess"". [ 11 ]

Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times was of a different opinion, she stated ""Ultimately, Angry Indian Goddesses is a decent watch as long as the fun lasts but tumbles downhill with gathering pace as the 'anger' kicks in"". [ 12 ]

In the West the film was poorly received by critics. Variety ' s Jay Weissberg criticized the director Pan Nalin for ""overload[ing] his jaunty wagon with weighty of-the-moment topics that it splinters into dozens of pieces"". [ 13 ]

Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter was of the same view, he wrote that ""[the film's] emphasis on the women's reactions to a variety of discriminatory situations starts to resemble a checklist approach, ticking off situations that cover career challenges, marriage dilemmas and personal relationships"". [ 14 ]

However, Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star who gave the film a score 2.5 out of 4 stars, called the actresses ""Goddesses"" who are ""crowd pleasers"". [ 15 ]

Also enjoying the film was Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail who didn't hesitate to write ""It works, partly because the Indian cinema, accustomed to epics encompassing musical, comedy and tragedy, has a sprawling sensibility and partly because the script, for all its sunshine and sentiment, has actually built to its startling conclusion"".

Dhadak,tt7638344,"Madhukar ""Madhu"" Bhagla, a young college student from a middle class family in Udaipur , wins a competitive eating contest and receives his prize from Parthavi Singh Rathore, a rich girl from a political family who also happens to be studying in the same college as Madhu. His friend Purshottam later finds Parthavi bathing in a lake and informs Madhu. Madhu impresses Parthavi but incurs a minor injury meanwhile. The two begin to have feelings for each other.

Madhu goes back to his family restaurant where his father makes him promise to stay away from Parthavi since she hails from a powerful, affluent upper-caste family. Madhu ignores Parthavi at college, but she later confronts him about him ignoring her. The two admit their love for each other and begin meeting secretly. Madhu asks Parthavi for a kiss, but she dares him to come to her brother Roop's birthday party. They share a kiss at the party, but are discovered by Parthavi's father, Ratan Singh Rathore. Roop and Ratan thrash Madhu and his friends but later are told by Inspector Shekhawat to calm down and wait for the election results before taking any severe action.

Once the elections are over, Madhu and his friends are arrested on false charges pressed by Ratan, who wins. Parthavi pleads with Ratan to release Madhu and his friends. In an ensuing scuffle, she manages to get hold of a gun and threatens to shoot herself if Madhu is not freed. Madhu runs up to her and together, they elope. With the police on their trail, Madhu and Parthavi board a train to Mumbai , where Madhu contacts his maternal uncle and the two travel to Nagpur .

Madhu's uncle advises them to go to Kolkata for the time being. While in Kolkata, they rent a small room for living; Madhu starts working in a roadside restaurant after learning Bengali while Parthavi finds work at a call centre. One day, Madhu goes to her office to gift her a new phone bought from his hard-earned money. Madhu sees Parthavi with her manager and thinks that she is cheating on him. Heartbroken, he returns home. After Parthavi returns home, they argue severely; Madhu slaps Parthavi in the heat of the moment and Parthavi begins to doubt why she came with Madhu. Parthavi is briefly missing, but Madhu finds her in her office and realises how much he loves her. He proposes to her and they marry.

Soon, Parthavi becomes pregnant and they have a son, Aditya ""Adi"" Bhagla. During the puja for their new house, Roop and his gang arrive with many gifts for her family, hinting at reconciliation. However, Madhu is not convinced and asks Parthavi to stay away but she brushes it off in excitement. Parthavi leaves her son at home with Madhu and steps out of the house. Madhu and Aditya are flung from the balcony and die in front of Parthavi, with Roop overlooking them.

Producer Karan Johar acquired the Hindi remake rights of the 2016 Marathi language film Sairat in November that year, after the film's unexpected commercial success. [ 8 ] On 15 November 2017, Johar announced through his Twitter handle that a film featuring Ishaan Khatter and Janhvi Kapoor in lead roles was under production, and released three first look posters to commemorate the event. [ 9 ] On the following day, he released another poster and revealed that the film was tentatively titled Dhadak and was an official remake of Sairat . [ 9 ] The film marks the debut of Janhvi Kapoor , daughter of Sridevi and Boney Kapoor . [ 10 ] Dhadak was meant to be Khatter's debut film too, but he was then cast by Majid Majidi in Beyond the Clouds (2018). [ 11 ]

Kapoor, who had watched Sairat for the first time with her mother Sridevi , expressed that she wanted to debut with a similar film. [ 11 ] A few days later, Johar approached her on her mother's insistence with the role of the female lead in the Hindi remake of Sairat . [ 11 ] Khatter watched Sairat after he was approached for the role, during which he learned that Shashank Khaitan was adapting it into a Hindi film. [ 11 ] Kapoor elaborated and wrote the backstory of her character so that the role felt ""more real"" to her. [ 11 ] Since Dhadak was set in Udaipur unlike Sairat , Khaitan took Kapoor and Khatter to Rajasthan and allowed them to spend time with the local people and eat the local food to make them understand the background, language and background of their characters. [ 11 ]

Khaitan preferred to call Dhadak an adaptation rather than a remake of Sairat since he had made some changes to the storyline of the original film. [ 12 ] He cited ""how Nagraj Manjule chose to tell that story and the uniqueness he brought to the film"" as his inspiration for the remake. [ 12 ] Khaitan, a Marwari Rajasthani himself who grew up in Kolkata , set Rajasthan and Kolkata as the premise for the film, and that required deviating from the original to stay ""true to [himself] and the story [he is] telling. [ 12 ] Another reason for choosing the two cities was ""that they are visually and linguistically so different from each other"". [ 12 ] Khaitan called Dhadak a tribute to Sairat . [ 12 ]

After he was sure that he wanted to make Dhadak , Khaitan worked to distance himself from Sairat , making Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017) in the meantime. [ 13 ] Later, he began writing Dhadak using those sequences which he instinctively recalled from Sairat , and eliminated those that did not come to him immediately. [ 13 ] After writing the script, about four to five months before filming, he told Khatter and Kapoor their characters' behaviour, speech, and their inter-personal relationships. [ 12 ] However, he did not treat Khatter or Kapoor as ""star kids"" since he wanted to create a ""good film"" with newcomers. Johar told him that the film ""could be the biggest decision in [his] life, or the biggest mistake in [his] life"". [ 13 ] Khaitan preferred to make a high quality film over one that was commercially viable. [ 13 ]

Principal photography commenced on 1 December 2017 in Udaipur, Rajasthan. [ 14 ] Kapoor was joined by her mother on the first day of filming. [ 14 ] Shortly after filming began, the shoot was disrupted in Jaipur , Rajasthan, after a part of the Ambikeshwar Mahadev Temple was damaged by the film's unit. [ 15 ] While scenes were being filmed at the Jagat Shiromani Temple and Panna Meena Ka Kund, the crew members had parked their vehicles near Ambikeshwar Temple. [ 15 ] One of their vans hit the chhajja of the temple. [ 15 ] A police case was lodged against the film unit head by the temple authorities for damaging their historic property. [ 15 ]

During the Jaipur schedule of filming, two sequences were filmed by onlookers and circulated on Instagram . [ 16 ] By contacting the Instagram Help Centre, the makers managed to remove  one of the videos, but the other kept circulating on social media. [ 16 ] This disrupted the filmmakers' plans to keep the character looks hidden. [ 16 ] After the incident, the a no-phone policy was practiced on the sets of Dhadak , in which mobile phones and cameras were banned from being carried even by members of the cast and crew. [ 16 ] The team urged the public to not indulge in such activities and to cooperate with them. [ 16 ]

In January 2018, the visuals for the song ""Zingaat"" was filmed. [ 17 ] It was choreographed by Farah Khan . [ 17 ] In the same month, the Kolkata schedule of principal photography began. [ 18 ] For a solo dance number picturised on Kapoor choreographed by Tushar Kalia , Kapoor rehearsed continuously for two days, and then shot it over a 24 hour period in a studio in Mumbai. [ 19 ] After Sridevi's unexpected death , the film's team took a break to allow Kapoor to pay respects to her mother. [ 20 ] She returned to filming shortly after. [ 20 ] In March 2018, shooting shifted to Kolkata; some of the sequences were filmed at Victoria Memorial. [ 21 ] Filming was completed by mid-April 2018. [ 22 ]

The music of the film is composed by Ajay–Atul while the lyrics are written by Amitabh Bhattacharya . The background score is composed by John Stewart Eduri. The music album of the film was released by Zee Music Company on 2 July 2018. The album was positively received. [ 23 ]

The song, ""Dhadak"", was mixed by Vijay Dayal at YRF Studios in Mumbai . The music video of the track was released on 19 June 2018, and features Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter . Composer Ajay said, “When we first heard the narration of Sairat , we knew that it was going to be an epic love story. So, while composing the music of the film that thought remained at the core. ""Dhadak Hai Na"" is a completely new composition, but it was made with the same thought of creating something epic. Like Sairat , the music of Dhadak has the quality of being cinematic and dramatic. It's made on an international soundscape and when listeners hear the theme song, I think they will feel the depth and the scale of composition"". John Stewart Eduri composed the background score. [ 24 ]

The song was released on 19 June 2018 on Zee Music Company 's YouTube page. On the same day of release, it was made available for online streaming at Saavn [ 25 ] and Gaana . [ 26 ] It garnered about 9 Million views within 24 hours. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] It trended at top position in India on YouTube India , Saavn and Gaana for almost a day. [ 29 ] It also trended at second and third positions on YouTube India for several days and completed 50 million views on 7 July 2018 and 100 million views on 3 September 2018.

Daily News and Analysis wrote, ""Shreya Ghoshal fans have fallen in love with her voice all over again"". The article even praised the lyrics of the song and the chemistry of the actors, stating, ""Everything from the lyrics, music to the chemistry of the lead actors has got a thumbs up from the audience."" [ 30 ] The track became an instant hit and many covers of the song were also made by various artists from all over India. Attaching some of these covers in her article, Rachna Srivastava wrote, ""Tripping on Dhadak's title track? Let these covers help you trip a li'l more"" [ 31 ] Writing for NDTV , Puja Sahu mentioned that the track has been trending at peak position on YouTube India and has garnered in about 9 Million views within a day of its release. The reporter further praised the chemistry between Janhvi and Ishaan. [ 28 ] An article in The Times of India read, ""Bollywood celebs go gaga over Ishaan Khatter and Janhvi Kapoor's romantic number. The soothing song sung by Ajay Gogavale and Shreya Ghoshal will tug at your heartstrings instantly."" [ 32 ]

The song debuted on Mirchi Music Top 20 countdown on 30 June 2018 at 5th position and climbed up to the 1st position in the next week itself. On Aircheck Top 20, the song debuted on 2 July 2018 at the peak position. The track was marked at the highest position at Saavn weekly Top 15 . It was also marked at Rank 1 at the Jio Music weekly Top 20 .

Dhadak ' s official trailer was released on 11 June 2018. [ 35 ] Despite being initially scheduled to release on 6 July 2018, [ 36 ] the film was postponed, and was instead released on 20 July 2018. [ 37 ] It was released in over 2235 screens in India and a total of 2791 screens worldwide. [ 38 ] Apart from India, the film was also released in the Middle East, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Fiji and Pakistan. [ 39 ]

Dhadak received negative reviews from critics. [ 40 ] It was particularly criticized for being a poor remake of Sairat , [ 40 ] glossing over the subject of caste-based discrimination present in the original. [ 41 ] Critics also felt that the film did not work as a standalone romance. [ 42 ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , Dhadak has a rating of 31% based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. [ 43 ] Rajeev Masand of News18 gave it two and a half stars out of five; while praising both Kapoor and Khatter for their acting prowess, he found the film to be ""relatively sanitized"", and questioned the logic behind remaking Sairat , writing, ""[T]he caste angle, evidently too hot to handle in a mainstream Bollywood film, is largely swept under the rug in Dhadak ."" [ 44 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film two stars out of five, expressing that ""[the] muddled screenplay, bland storytelling and uneven lead performances leave this glossy Karan Johar production without a proper, palpable heartbeat"", concluding, ""The result is a grind that pretty frames and fresh faces cannot mitigate"". [ 45 ]

Writing for The Times of India , Rachit Gupta gave the film three and a half stars out of five and praised the direction, ""[Khaitan] presents the naive romance with sensitivity, even while fusing the story with ample dramatic highs"". While noting that the ""glossed over aspect makes it unbelievable"", Gupta was more positive, writing, ""With all its strengths and weaknesses, Dhadak attempts to highlight some shocking truths about our society and for that it makes a worthy watch."" [ 46 ] Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave it two and a half stars out of five, writing, ""Though Khaitan has tried to deliver subtle messages..., in the end, all this boils down to launching two potential future stars."" Vats also noted that ""[Kapoor] and [Khatter] were probably misfits for a rural setting"". [ 47 ] A reviewer for the Indo-Asian News Service gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying, ""The remake extracts all the juice from the original and then squanders it in irrelevant plot conversions"" but deduces: ""If Dhadak is still watchable in parts, it's because Ishaan Khattar [ sic ] is constantly injecting his exuberant conviction into every scene."" [ 48 ]

Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave Dhadak one and a half stars out of five and said, ""Barring a few patches, Dhadak has neither requisite drama nor authenticity. It underlines all its scenes with blaring background music, to tell us how to feel. It doesn’t work, not as an official copy of Sairat , nor as a standalone Bollywood romance."" [ 49 ] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave it two stars out of five and writes, ""The heartbreak of shabby treatment from one's own family, the struggle of employment sans proper qualification in an alien city, the resentment, doubts and insecurities spawned by unending challenges hardly registers in Dhadak ' s superficial, clueless worldview."" However, she praised Khatter, who ""never seems out of his depth no matter how silly the setup"" and Kapoor for her expressive "" Chandni eyes"". [ 50 ] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film one and a half stars out of five and criticized, ""In Dhadak , [time and thought]... are sketchily written, as are the pair’s struggles in their new life away from their parents"". [ 51 ]

Game (2011 film),tt1772872,"Kabir Malhotra ( Anupam Kher ) is a billionaire tycoon who invites four people to his island home in Greece, by sending a different letter to each. The four people, who have never met before, are: Neil Menon ( Abhishek Bachchan ), a casino owner in Turkey . He has financial problems with mob bosses that Kabir offers to help with, Vikram Kapoor ( Jimmy Sheirgill ), an actor in India , who suffers with drug, cancer and career problems. Kabir writes to him that he wants to finance the biggest film ever made, and offers Vikram a role in it, Om Prakash ""OP"" Ramsay ( Boman Irani ), a political leader and prime ministerial candidate in Thailand . His campaign is under threat of scandal, and Kabir offers to provide new funding to him, Tisha Khanna ( Shahana Goswami ), a crime journalist in the United Kingdom who is looking for her big break. Kabir writes to her, saying that he has a huge story and invites her to cover it.

The four guests arrive on the island, where they are greeted by Kabir's executive assistant, Samara Shroff ( Gauahar Khan ), who takes them into a dining room that is being secretly filmed. There, Kabir reveals that he has invited them because of their link to his daughter, Maya ( Sarah-Jane Dias ), whom Kabir has spent years trying to find. Maya was trafficked as a child by OP Ramsay, as an adult brought into the crime world by Neil Menon, and in the end, hit by a car in a car accident and buried alive by Vikram Kapoor. Kabir has gathered evidence against the three of them and invited the International Vigilance Squad (IVS) to the island to arrest them. Tisha Khanna, the only innocent one of the group, was invited because, previously unknown to her, she is Maya's fraternal twin sister and Kabir's only remaining biological child. Tisha rejects Kabir's attempts to forge a relationship with her, claiming that she doesn't want his fortune.

Unable to escape the island, the group await the arrival of the IVS. In the morning, they hear what sounds like a gunshot from Kabir's room. They find Kabir Malhotra dead in his study, seemingly having committed suicide with a gun.

The IVS, led by Sia Agnihotri ( Kangana Ranaut ), arrive on the island. She watches the video of the previous night's speech by Kabir, but as they are unable to find the evidence that Kabir claimed to have, they let the guests go. Although the case is officially declared a suicide, Sia is not convinced and puts all four guests under surveillance.

Through flashback, it is revealed that Neil was in love with Maya, who saved his life during a shootout at his casino. And also that on the day of her death, she told Neil, through a voice mail that she was pregnant with their child. In the present day, Neil evades Sia's surveillance, and takes revenge on OP Ramsay and Vikram for what they did to Maya. Both are tricked into giving public confessions of their crimes. Vikram commits suicide, and OP Ramsay dies of a heart attack (his medication being stolen by Neil). Sia, who has been monitoring Vikram and OP Ramsay, knows that Neil is responsible.

It is revealed that Neil is also an officer of the IVS. His real name is Major Arjun Singhania, and he has been in deep cover for many years in the Turkish drug cartel. He, too, doesn't believe that Kabir committed suicide, and works together with Sia to find the true culprit. Neil noticed that Kabir was left-handed, yet the gun that killed him was in his right hand.

Tisha, as Kabir Malhotra's only child, is to inherit Kabir's fortune, but Neil and Sia receive news that Tisha attempted suicide. When Tisha wakes up, she tells them that it wasn't suicide, but someone attacked her in her house. Meanwhile, it is found that Kabir has a brother, Iqbal, who is next in line to inherit his fortune. Sia and Neil travel to the missionary where Iqbal lives, but they find him too ill to speak to them. A nurse tells them that Iqbal had a daughter who died, but Neil notices that there are letters sent to him dated after her supposed to death, so she must still be alive.

Neil and Sia travel back to the island, where they confront the late Kabir's personal assistant, Samara. It is revealed that Samara is actually Natasha, Iqbal's daughter and Kabir's biological niece, though Kabir never knew. Neil realised that there was foul play when, at the missionary, he saw a picture of Kabir and Iqbal when they were children, and they were identical twins, so the man in the missionary couldn't have been Kabir's brother. Iqbal reveals himself, explaining that he's been working with Natasha to get Kabir's fortune. Tisha was a surprise they hadn't anticipated, so they had to take her out of the picture. They used Kabir's three guilty guests to deflect suspicion from Samara, predicting correctly that the police would suspect one of the guests as responsible for Kabir's murder.

Iqbal attempts to kill Neil and Sia, but Neil resists, which results in Iqbal being killed and Natasha arrested.

Rehmat befriends a girl named Minnie who is of the same age as his own daughter and one day he disappears from her life. Many years later a grown-up Minnie, who is now a documentary film-maker living in France , learns about her father, who died in a plane crash while travelling to Afghanistan.

Debashish says that, ""When Sunil said to do this film I felt it was everything that I wanted to do in my first feature – it had children, magic realism, nostalgia, travel, and says something about the world we live in and how people are suffering."" [ 10 ]

In 2016, Deb Medhekar's Bioscopewala was selected to be a part of the Work-in-Progress lab at the 10th NFDC Film Bazaar (an annual event where filmmakers present a rough cut of their projects for review and feedback by a panel of international film experts) held in Goa during 20–24 November 2016. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]

Director Deb Medhekar says that for the role of Minnie Basu he was not just looking for a good actress but also someone who resembles Meena Kumari , as a result of which he finalized Geetanjali Thapa for the role. Deb says, ""I am a big Meena Kumari fan and I think no other actress can look as authentically beautiful and Bengali as Meena Kumari did in ‘Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam’. So when I was casting Mini in ‘Bioscopewala’ as an adult, I cast Geetanjali Thapa because she has an uncanny resemblance."" [ 14 ]

There is only one song in the film, titled Bioscopewala . Sung by K Mohan this song was composed by Sandesh Shandilya while the lyrics were written by Gulzar .

Reza Noorani of The Times of India praised the performances of Danny Denzongpa and Geetanjali Thapa and gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 saying that, ""At one hour and 31 minutes, the film doesn’t waiver much and wraps up the loose ends perfectly."" [ 16 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 saying that, ""Danny Denzongpa's Performance Is First-Rate In This Well-Crafted Sparkling Little Gem."" [ 17 ] Prasanna D Zore of Rediff gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and said that Bioscopewala ""is a sweet film, soothing to the eyes, and weaves a story of human suffering cutting across national boundaries."" [ 18 ] Rajeev Masand of News18 called the film ""a smart, moving adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s Kabuliwala."" The critic praised the performances of all actors with special mention for Danny Denzongpa and concluded his review saying, ""Make time for Bioscopewala, it’s a deeply affecting film, imbued with a lingering love for cinema."" [ 19 ] The Indian Express praised the performances of Danny Denzongpa and Brijendra Kala but felt that the film failed to tap its complete potential and gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5. [ 20 ] Sweta Kausal of Hindustan Times praised the adaptation as well as the performances of all actors and gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5. [ 21 ] Shrishti Negi of News18 gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 and said that, ""In a rising atmosphere of cultural intolerance, hate and violence, director Deb Medhekar’s Bioscopewala promises hope and manages to convey the more heart-warming emotion of humankind.""

Gabbar Is Back,tt2424988,"The police get information that 10 tehsildars across Maharashtra have been mysteriously kidnapped. However, no sooner are they mysteriously returned – except the most corrupt officer, who is hanged . The police get a CD from mystery man 'Gabbar', who says his mission is to target corrupt officers. Police driver Sadhuram is convinced he can crack the mystery of who is Gabbar.

National College professor Aditya thrashes some goons who try to vandalize college property. On his way home one night, he encounters a young lawyer, Shruti, who is in a hurry to take a pregnant woman to the hospital. Some days later, she bumps into Aditya again during a fight, and they begin dating. Sadhuram in the meantime finds out there's one honest officer in each department across the state, and is convinced that each of these honest officers has a link to Gabbar.

One fateful day, Aditya and Shruti are checking out of a roadside café when Shruti is hurt in a minor accident, and Aditya takes her to the Patil Hospital where a female doctor insists on taking a number of expensive tests. Aditya happens to overhear a doctor try to suggest the rather expensive Caesarean section delivery and is soon convinced of the hospital staff's dirty tricks when he notices a father-daughter duo being informed of the mother's death only after an expensive bill was paid. He deliberately checks in a poor woman's dead husband as a patient; unaware of his trap, the hospital tries to swindle money out of Aditya by pretending to treat the already dead man, making him pay heavily for tests and medicines. However, Aditya shows them the death certificate as a proof of their knowingly admitting a dead man. The young owner of the hospital, Vikas Patil, is furious when Aditya releases the video of the hospital's corruption to the media despite having struck a deal with him. Vikas is murdered by the enraged public, and his father Digvijay Patil sees Aditya in the hospital CCTV footage, only to realize this is the same man he had supposedly killed five years ago.

A flashback soon reveals that Aditya's pregnant wife Sunaina died when the buildings in their colony collapsed and killed hundreds of other people too. Aditya collected proof of the faulty buildings against builder Digvijay, who bribed everyone and tried to bribe Aditya too by offering Rs. 10 million to spare the matter, but Aditya spurned the offer by fighting everyone in the room and nearly killing Digvijay. Aditya spared him when the latter asked for forgiveness, but Digvijay brutally retaliated by hitting him with an axe and left him for dead. However, a bus full of medical students found the unconscious Aditya on a highway and saved his life. He then decided to use the power of idealistic, young, honest youths and trained students at National College to join his cause. Meanwhile, Sadhuram finds that all the honest officers attended National College for graduation. Shruti discovers that Aditya is the real Gabbar and is shocked but when he tells her the truth, she supports his cause.

CBI officer Kuldeep Pahwa takes charge of the case and is mystified by the facts. He listens to Sadhuram's findings, and they arrest the National College students listed by Sadhuram, but upon being beaten, the students do not divulge anything about Gabbar, which enrages him further. Shruti tells Kuldeep that because the law doesn't work, a vigilante like Gabbar has become a hero for ordinary citizens. Sadhuram changes his view of Gabbar. Digvijay kills an honest officer to terrorize others into passing his faulty building plans. Gabbar targets Digvijay for his act. Digvijay throws a birthday party for himself, and as he cuts the cake, he spots Aditya. Aditya and his gang kidnap him. As police search the city for Digvijay in vain, Aditya kills Digvijay in a fight that ensues between the two, following which he surrenders himself to the police and is eventually given a death penalty , sparking huge public protests and enraged students block his jail van. Kuldeep requests him to speak to the students and he does, telling them to channel their anger against corruption and be the change society needs. Finally, while being prepared to be hanged, Aditya remarks that he will die but the movement will live on.

The songs of Gabbar Is Back were composed by Chirantan Bhatt , Yo Yo Honey Singh and Manj Musik , while the lyrics were written by Manoj Yadav, Kumaar , Sahil Kaushal, Manj Musik , Raftaar and Big Dhillon.

Heartbroken, Zoya attempts to retaliate but is stopped by Parma's mother, Parvati, who urges her son to honor his actions. When Parvati tries to protect the couple, Surya fatally shoots her, prompting Parma to turn against his family and protect Zoya.

Forced to flee, the couple seeks refuge in a brothel managed by Chand Bibi. Although Zoya initially suspects Parma of betrayal, she begins to forgive him as he expresses remorse. They eventually reconcile and marry in a legitimate ceremony. Hoping for reconciliation, Zoya brings Parma to her home, but her father threatens to kill her. The couple escapes once again, planning to flee to Jaipur . However, their families join forces to track them down, viewing their union as a threat to both political legacies and religious boundaries.

Cornered on a college rooftop during Eid , Parma and Zoya engage in a final standoff with their pursuers. With no escape and few bullets left, they choose to shoot each other, dying in each other's arms. Their families depart, believing the matter settled. The film concludes with a message highlighting the tragic consequences faced by interfaith and intercaste couples in contemporary India.

Sarkar 3,tt5742874,"Business tycoon Deven Gandhi approaches Subhash Nagre ""Sarkar"" for a real estate project over a large slum in Dharavi Mumbai. Sarkar suggests that Gandhi should offer appropriate compensation and relocate the slum dwellers. Gandhi deems that too expensive and would rather offer a smaller commission to Sarkar to force the relocation. Sarkar refuses, and when Gandhi insists that he will go to another power bastion, Sarkar asserts that he will not let Gandhi go ahead. Gandhi reports back to his Dubai-based boss, Vallya. They join hands with a rival opposition leader named Govind Deshpande and plot to oust Sarkar.

Sarkar's wife pleads with him to permit their grandson Shivaji Nagre ""Chiku"" to join him. Sarkar hesitates: the boy is hot-headed and volatile like his deceased father, Vishnu Nagre, but ultimately relents. Chiku immediately clashes with Gokul (Sarkar's long-time loyal right-hand man) and accomplice Raman Guru  over various matters, including whether or not to eliminate Deshpande. It is implied that Chiku's girlfriend Annu  is using him to get to Sarkar because Sarkar had apparently eliminated her father. Meanwhile, Gandhi approaches Gokul with the proposition to help him; otherwise, Chiku would become the next Sarkar and Gokul would remain a servant.

Deshpande plots with Gandhi and Vallya to instigate mill workers against Sarkar. Chikku is on the warpath to attack Deshpande. Sarkar tries to determine who is behind everything. One day, Deshpande is hotly pursued and killed, and Sarkar, who has long held a reputation for bumping the opposition, is blamed. Sarkar notes that whoever did this is determined and cunning and will stop at nothing. When assassins open fire on Sarkar at the Ganpati Visarjan festival, it becomes clear that Sarkar's inner circle has been breached. Chikku shows Sarkar the video of Gandhi meeting Gokul and, separately, Gokul remonstrates and says that Chiku, used by the wily Annu and his own vengeance for his father, is behind everything. Sarkar expels Chiku, and Chiku joins Gandhi.

Vallya organises a bomb blast at the mill. Gokul reports that it was executed by Chikku, who is now out to destroy Sarkar, and Gandhi. Around this time, Sarkar's wife passes away, and Gokul beseeches Sarkar to give the order to kill Chikku. Chikku is shot at, but he escapes. Gokul begins hunting him down. But Gokul is then, presumably, shot dead by Chiku, and Sarkar swears vengeance.

Vallya arrives in India to meet Sarkar. He points out that Chiku is too inexperienced to become Sarkar and is useless, and offers to help Sarkar eliminate Chiku. Sarkar discloses that Chiku was dispatched to infiltrate Gandhi by none other than Sarkar himself and that it was he who ordered Gokul's killing. Annu discovers that it was Gandhi who killed her father, not Sarkar, and she shoots him.

Hindsight reveals that differences with Annu had been cleared and she was taken into confidence, and that Gokul had turned to Gandhi and played a part in the mill agitation and the slum development in order to sideline Chiku, eventually hoping to become Sarkar. Their objective was to draw out Vallya. Chiku walks in, kills Raman Guru, there is another gunshot, and Vallya is shown dead. With their adversaries now dead, Sarkar and Chiku sip tea while Sarkar educates the inexperienced Chiku on palace politics .

In 2009, Ram Gopal Varma stated that he had no plans finalised for the third installment in the series and subsequently shelved Sarkar 3 . [ 5 ] However, in 2012, it was reported that the sequel was in the pre production stage. The film was expected to go on floors at the end of 2013, primarily with the same cast of Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan , albeit leaving the latter's character dead at the end of Sarkar Raj. Aishwarya Rai was reported to have been left out. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]

Dear Maya,tt6033536,"The film opens into the lives of teenage girls Anna and Ira, students at a convent (Catholic) school in Shimla. They are particularly close and divide their daytime between school and romance novels and boys and, occasionally, sleepovers. They are very intrigued by their reclusive middle-aged neighbor Maya Devi, who lives alone in a large house (with her two dogs) and rarely goes out. Anna's mother explains that Maya Devi lost her father early and lived in that house with her chacha (father's brother) and mother. Maya Devi was, and still is, a beautiful girl, but her chacha constantly thwarted her marriage (by berating her and chasing away suitors). This was because he stood to inherit her estate. In time he died, and Maya resigned herself to a dreary and solitary life.

Ira devises a plan to write love letters to Maya. The girls hope that this prank may bring some light into Maya's life. They write letters, vivid and touching and steamy, pretending to be a former suitor, now in Delhi, still pining for Maya. Ira takes the prank further by breaking into Maya's house one evening to steal a photograph. This goes badly; Ira breaks her ankle, as does Maya's maid; the girls are reprimanded, and Anna is tasked with filling in for the maid until the maid recovers. During this time, Anna gets a little closer to Maya. The letters still arrive, and Anna observes that Maya becomes happier with each new letter.

One day Maya stuns everyone by announcing that she is selling the house and moving to Delhi to find the letter writer, her long lost suitor. Anna discovers, to her horror, that the letter which prompted the decision was written by Ira and had an explicit invitation. She runs to dissuade Maya but is unable to do so. She confides in her mother. Anna is reprimanded and sent away to boarding school, away from Ira. Anna leaves without saying goodbye to Ira and they never speak again. Ira is shattered.

Torn by the guilt of her prank, Anna makes it her mission to find Maya in Delhi. Over the next six years, she sticks posters, makes phone calls, and follows every lead to find Maya. She finds a boyfriend, Rahul, who ultimately proposes to her but she is unable to accept. She returns to Shimla to discuss this with her parents. Ira visits her, but Anna is still angry and turns her away. Ira is profusely sorry and persists and ultimately accompanies Anna back to Delhi. Anna is still mad at Ira for her selfish and childish behaviour which likely destroyed Maya's life, but Ira reveals that she, too, had fallen in love with Shimla and had lost her love to a motor accident, and now, having lost love, is fully aware of the true consequences of her pranks. Anna forgives Ira and persuades her to transfer to a college in Delhi. But Ira decides to return to Shimla. As Anna bids goodbye to Ira at the train station, she receives a phone call from Maya.

The girls hurry to meet Maya. To their astonishment, they find her, bright and sparkling and happy, at the zoo garden. Maya reveals her story. She had arrived in Delhi and tried to trace the letter writer but found nothing. Instead, over time, she found that Delhi and the world outside Shimla were not so frightening after all. People were helpful and kind. And she eventually met a kind and charming man who owned a jewelry shop. In time she became close to this man, Ved, and they married. And today Maya is blissfully happy with her Ved. The letters changed her life, and she tells them to say 'yes' to life. Anna and Ira are stunned. They joyfully hug Maya, and she embraces them and invites them to call at any time.

The film ends as Anna accepts Rahul's proposal and Ira transfers to a college in Delhi.

Finding Fanny,tt3142688,"Ferdie Pinto receives a letter at midnight and realises that his one true love, Fanny Fernandes, never knew how he felt about her. Angie, Ferdie's friend had married Gabo Eucharistica who died suddenly [ a ] during a wedding party. Determined to find Fanny, Ferdie and Angie set out on a journey, joined by Savio Da Gama (a friend of both Angie and Gabo), Gabo’s mother Rosie, and the unsavory artist Don Pedro Cleto Collaco. In the past, Savio had loved Angie but stepped aside after she married Gabo.

On the journey, Ferdie throws Rosie's cat out of the window by accident whilst sneezing as he is allergic; so to keep her unaware, he retrieves the dead cat and pretends that it is sleeping. They visit Fanny's old house and find a deranged Russian Vladimir who tells them Fanny sold him the house 20 years ago and moved to Tivoli. Ferdie tells Savio that Rosie's husband is not dead, but instead had run away to Madagascar with another woman, and Rosie had simply lied to the village for the sake of her pride. As they approach Tivoli, Ferdie thanks everyone for joining him on his journey – but unbeknownst to him, most of the other passengers have their own reasons for making the trip. Savio soon realizes that they have gone the wrong way, and are now in the state of Karnataka due to wrong navigation by Ferdie, who cannot read a map. When they run out of petrol, Ferdie volunteers to go and get some in the morning; so the group spends the night in the open field next to the road. Don Pedro tries to seduce Rosie into being a model for his painting, whilst Savio and Angie go away from the others to talk. Savio tells Angie that he does not have a big business in Mumbai as presumed, but rather he was a waiter for 5 years and is not wealthy. It is revealed that Angie only married Gabo because Savio never asked her, and she was in love with Savio as he was with her. He kisses her and she slaps him. They eventually talk and after realizing that they both still have feelings for each other, have sex that night.

In the morning, Ferdie goes to get petrol and comes back to find Rosie posing in the field for Don Pedro and Angie and Savio busy talking. The artist has now dropped his charming attitude of suave sophistication and is mistreating Rosie. When she sees the painting, she is devastated to find that it is a nude unflattering portrait of her. Don Pedro walks off with the painting and finds the can of petrol that Ferdie has left, along with a letter explaining that he is going on alone and thanking them for coming this far with him. The rest of them start to leave but Rosie refuses to go, saying that they can't leave Ferdie. She gets extremely upset and begins to yell at Savio, telling him that he should have died instead of Gabo and that Gabo only married Angie because Savio was in love with her. Savio angrily tells Rosie that she is selfish and reveals that her cat is actually dead, but she hadn't even noticed, leaving everyone else to look after it. They bury the cat and set off home. On the way, Rosie accidentally opens the glove compartment in the car and finds Savio's father's revolver. She puts it to her head, intending to shoot herself. When no one notices, she coughs and Savio sees his dad's revolver, which is an antique and worth a lot of money. He begins to wrestle with Rosie for the gun whilst driving, causing it to go off and Don Pedro gets shot in the head, without anyone noticing. They turn the car around and go to look for Ferdie; finding him by the roadside waiting for the bus, but can't pick him up as the car brakes fail. The back door of the car opens and when the car veers close to the cliff edge, Don Pedro's body falls out. The car eventually comes to a stop and Angie notices that Don Pedro has gone. Rosie says that he jumped out of the car to save himself, but Ferdie sees someone who he thinks is Don Pedro on a passing bus, while in fact, his body is at the bottom of the sea.

The group then carries on to Tivoli to find Fanny. They get to the village and see a funeral procession go past. Ferdie sees a woman that he thinks is Fanny, only to discover that she is Fanny's daughter ( Anjali Patil ) and the funeral procession is for Fanny. Ferdie is told by the daughter that Fanny was married four times and never even mentioned his name to her daughter, implying that he wasn't important to her. They go to the funeral and Angie muses that you can't wait for love, you must go out and find it.

Six months later, there is a wedding in the church. The couple is presumed to be Savio and Angie but is in fact, Ferdie and Rosie. The happy couple drives away into the sunset, leaving behind Angie and Savio kissing near the church as they leave.

Homi Adajania wrote the first draft of the screenplay during his month-long stay at village Salvador do Mundo . During this period he also studied local Goan Catholics , and added some dysfunctional characters into what he called, ""hybrid Marquezian Indian village"", which became the fictional village of Pocolim. To get local nuances and cultural research right, he took the help of Goan writer, Cecil Pinto. Adajania didn't intend to write the film as a road film, instead he placed it in the genre of As Good as It Gets (1997). This was his second collaboration with Kersi Khambatta, who also wrote the dialogues for his debut film, Being Cyrus (2006). Khambatta wrote the scenes, chapter by chapter, like a novel, which aided in the development of the script. [ 10 ] The screenplay of Finding Fanny was adapted from a novel by Kersi Khambatta. The 200-page novel is expected to hit shelves later in 2015. [ 11 ]

He had finished writing the script of Finding Fanny by 2009, 4 years after his first directorial venture Being Cyrus released. [ citation needed ] However, casting for the film became an issue as it was an offbeat film— Imran Khan and Sonam Kapoor were initially offered roles in the films, though they turned their respective parts down. [ 12 ] Dinesh Vijan had suggested against making the film, advising Adajania that ""you are going to make a Hinglish film which only 10 people will see."" [ 13 ] Hence, Adajania postponed the film and went on to direct Cocktail instead. During the shooting of Cocktail , his narration of the story to lead actress Deepika Padukone had impressed her, and she expressed her desire to be a part of the film. [ 14 ]

In May 2013, Deepika Padukone and Arjun Kapoor were signed on for leading roles, the latter being assigned the part of ""a mechanic, who's in denial about being a loser."" [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Reportedly, Padukone has reduced her usual fee for the film and has also signed a profit-sharing deal with the producers. [ 17 ] By August 2013, Naseeruddin Shah and Dimple Kapadia , who earlier featured in Being Cyrus , were signed on for the film; Pankaj Kapur joined the cast the following month. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Whilst the film was earlier reported to be a short film, Padukone confirmed in an interview that this was untrue. [ 20 ] The film will be showcased in English and Hindi versions to cater for the audience in India and abroad. [ 21 ]

Before the filming could commence, sessions and workshops were organised with the actors. A month prior shooting, Adajania and Naseeruddin Shah figured out where to place the latter's character emotionally and his body language, through story arc from vulnerable, even ""borderline idiotic"" to coming into his strength later in the film. Shah decided to use a mid-range voice, instead of his natural baritone. Arjun Kapoor was convinced to use a restraint acting style, compared to his usual dramatic style, and appear in the ""effortlessness of just being"". [ 10 ]

Shooting of the film began in October 2013. [ 18 ] The film was shot in various villages across Goa, including Saligao , Parra , Assagao , Aldona , Socorro , and Cortalim , [ 10 ] and was completed in 36 days. [ 22 ] Dimple Kapadia wore a prosthetic posterior for the film, as she did in Rudaali (1993). [ 23 ] The film was shot in English, the Hindi version was subsequently, dubbed in by the actors. [ 10 ] On 4 July 2014, the cast shot for a promotional music video for the song ""Shake Your Bootiya"". The freewheeling dance number was choreographed by Shiamak Davar , giving the actors quirky moves, in keeping with the tone of the film. [ 24 ]

The music of Finding Fanny was composed by Mathias Duplessy, duo Sachin–Jigar and the lyrics were penned by a range of artists including, Mukhtiyar Ali , Alan Mercer, Mayur Puri and the film's producer, Dinesh Vijan . The first song ""Fanny Re"" released on 11 August 2014 in an event in Mumbai where the second song, ""Shake Your Bootiya"" written by Dinesh Vijan, Mayur Puri and composed by Sachin–Jigar was also announced. [ 26 ] The film's soundtrack officially released on 19 August 2014.

The International English version was edited by Nick Moore . [ 21 ] The director, Homi Adajania expressed interest in premiering the film at the Toronto International Film Festival . [ 27 ] However, it was decided the film will premiere in India 11 days prior to the film's worldwide release, on 1 September 2014 and therefore the makers decided against the decision. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The film has also screened at Busan International Film Festival in October 2014. [ 30 ]

Ahead of its release, the film got into a tangle with the Censor Board of India . Late August, the Board asked the director to delete a supposedly 'vulgar' line from the film wherein, Deepika Padukone says, ""I'm a virgin"" to get a UA certificate. The board also demanded a scene wherein Dimple Kapadia's skirt gets torn be ""toned down"". [ 31 ] [ 32 ] As of 1 September 2014, the film was still waiting for approval from the Censor Board. The process was slowed down due to arrest of Central Board CEO, on bribery charges. The film was also rejected permission twice by the Animal Welfare Board of India , due to a scene involving a hen. [ 33 ] On 5 September, Adajania confirmed that the CBFC has finally approved the Deepika Padukone dialogue, which was previously removed. This came after, he pointed out to the CBFC chairperson that, it had already approved the same in film's trailer. [ 34 ]

On 2 July 2014, the first promotional pictures were released of Arjun Kapoor as Savio Da Gama and Deepika Padukone as Angie. In the picture, Arjun Kapoor dons a pair of shades and a vest, while Deepika Padukone, who plays a Goan girl, is seen wearing an apron and holding a blood stricken butcher's knife. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] On 8 July 2014, the official posters for the film were released and on 10 July 2014, the official trailer was released. [ 37 ] As a first, the makers decided to premiere the film on 1 September 2014 to gauge the response of the film before it releases worldwide. [ 38 ]

Finding Fanny received critical acclaim upon release. [ 39 ]

Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave the film four stars and said the film gives ""much to smile pleasantly at [and] to guffaw at."" [ 40 ] A reviewer from Bollywood Hungama said, ""Writer-director Homi Adajania has dared to break all conventional rules and manages to serve an absorbing and entertaining story that keeps you interested [...] It will surely appeal to the target group of a discerning audience that values sensible entertainment."" [ 41 ] Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times commented that ""all the actors have done a brilliant job, fitting perfectly in their characters"" and described the picture as a ""not-to-be-missed take on life and love"". [ 42 ] In a four-star review, Mumbai Mirror ' s Rahul Desai regarded the film as a breakthrough film involving commercial actors, saying ""This film is exactly the kind of brave clutter-breaking effort that most critics wish for while lamenting the rigidness of mainstream stars."" [ 43 ] Sarita Tanwar of Daily News and Analysis praised the film for being ""real, funny and thoughtful"". [ 44 ]

The film collected ₹ 51 million (US$600,000) on its opening day on a total of 900 screens which previewed both English and Hindi versions.

Years ago, when he was still young, Chulbul, whose real name turns out to be Dhaakad Chand Pandey, fell in love with a girl, Khushi, who was initially being considered as a potential bride for Makkhi, after he noticed a photo of her in Makkhi's hand, and told his mother, Naini Devi, that he would be a good fit instead of Makkhi; a few days later, Khushi's maternal uncle Prabhat and maternal aunt Janki agreed to the match between Dhaakad and Khushi, and the two began courting each other. At the same time, Bali, a ruthless and violent goon, set his eyes on Khushi and started making arrangements for his marriage with her. However, when he saw Dhaakad with Khushi, he decided to kill Khushi and her family right in front of Dhaakad's eyes after luring him to the spot. Prabhat and Janki were both killed, and Khushi was thrown off a cliff to die. Consequently, Hariya and his daughter Rajjo revealed to be Khushi's friend, were deeply affected; Hariya took to alcoholism, while Dhaakad, who was framed by Bali and spent much time in prison for the death, was taken in by Commissioner Satendar Singh after saving him from attackers, and transformed into an uptight cop, naming himself Chulbul, in Khushi's memory, forming the events of Dabangg .

At present, Chulbul, having relayed this entire episode to Prajapati and Rajjo, decides that he has had enough, and he needs to close the chapter once and for good. Meanwhile, an ill-attracted Makkhi is misled by Bali into turning against Chulbul, nearly slapping him after he too is promoted to the rank of ASP. The action causes him to be banished from home by Prajapati, and he joins hands with Bali actively. Bali, who is set to become a politician and a minister in the upcoming elections, plans to bring in a truck filled with money. Thus, he gets Makkhi and many other police officers in his circle transferred to one common location to facilitate transportation. Chulbul intercepts the truck and turns Bali's moles in the police force against Bali himself. As revenge, Bali gets several of Chulbul's associates kidnapped and brutally beaten to near death until Chulbul breaks in again and frees them all, even when Bali has run away with Makkhi and some reliable accomplices.

Seeking to lure Bali into counterproductive action, Chulbul kidnaps Minister S. S. Sharma and his brother-in-law by staging a ploy with Gullu's help and forcing a confession of them, which is made viral. Bali notices the same, and Makkhi helps him track them down since he recognizes the hideout. Upon arriving there, Bali kills Sharma and injures his brother-in-law; in retaliation, he sends wrestlers to attack Rajjo and her son, but Chulbul arrives in time to save the two.

Sometime later, Chulbul receives a call from Prajapati, who tells him that Rajjo hasn't arrived home. Sensing Bali's hand in the matter, he invades a quarry where Bali has held Rajjo, and surprisingly, Makkhi himself, as hostages – Makkhi was always on Chulbul's side, and it was a game by the brothers to incense Bali; after an intense fight, Chulbul kills Bali by impaling him on a metal spike. He then buries Bali in the rubble.

Aisa Yeh Jahaan,tt4760900,"The film is set in Mumbai . It depicts the relationship between a husband and wife, the ever-growing human detachment from nature and people's attitude towards the physiology of a child's growth which is portrayed in a lighthearted yet satirical fashion. [ 2 ] Rajib works for a multinational company and is far apart in terms of his nature from his wife, Ananya, who is a receptionist at a private firm. On the other hand, Kuhi, their three-year-old daughter, and Pakhi, the domestic help of the house, share a relationship based on innocence and pure emotions. Pakhi takes good care of Kuhi when Rajib and Ananya are away at work during the day. The whole family plans a vacation to their hometown Golaghat in Assam . There, Kuhi gets to know Nalia Kai, the helper of the house, who introduces her to a new world – a world of trees, birds, greenery, paddy fields and the environment at large. There she realizes the difference between the concrete world of Mumbai and the natural environment of her father's hometown. She also fears that one day the people of Mumbai would not have air to breathe, as she learns that we get oxygen from trees. This compels her to question the scarcity of trees in Mumbai. [ 3 ]

[ 14 ] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare wasn't impressed with the film and said that, ""The film suffers from a busload of bad direction. It’s got a good heart. The efforts of Dr Palash Sen and Ira Dubey do make the film worthwhile, but even they left are [ sic ] grappling with a short rope. The story is too disjointed.

Uri: The Surgical Strike,tt8291224,"The film is divided into five chapters.

The first chapter opens up with an ambush in June 2015 on the convoy of the Indian Army troops in Chandel , Manipur by NSCN(K) militants. In retaliation, Major Vihaan Singh Shergill, a Para SF officer and his unit, including his brother-in-law, Major Karan Kashyap, infiltrate and attack the Northeastern militants and also kill the key leader responsible for the ambush . After a successful strike, the Prime Minister of India congratulates him and the whole unit at a formal dinner . Vihaan requests an early retirement as he wants to be close with his mother, who is suffering from Stage VI Alzheimer's , on which the Prime Minister offers him a desk job at New Delhi near his mother instead of retirement, to which he agrees. [ 12 ]

The second chapter shows Vihaan taking a desk job at the Integrated Defence Staff HQ in New Delhi and him spending time with his family. This segment also briefly describes the Pathankot attack . A nurse named Jasmine D'Almeida is assigned to take care of Vihaan's mother. Vihaan meets an Indian Air Force pilot named Flight Lieutenant Seerat Kaur, who is trying to prove her patriotism to her martyred husband, who was an army officer who died in an ambush. One day, Vihaan's mother goes missing. He searches for her, and blames Jasmine for her ignorance, stating that there is no need for her security. Vihaan's mother is found under a bridge, and Jasmine reveals herself as an intelligence agent. The film reveals why the families of the special forces soldiers were given security due to the threat from the North-eastern terrorists.

On 18 September 2016, four heavily armed militants attack the brigade headquarters at Uri , Jammu and Kashmir at dawn, killing 19 soldiers in their sleep. The terrorists are killed, but Karan dies in a grenade explosion due to accidentally pulling the pin attached to the terrorist's rifle, which he picked up to examine. The whole family becomes devastated, including Vihaan. The Ministry decides to take strict action against the perpetrators of the attack. National Security Advisor Govind Bharadwaj suggests the idea of a surgical strike . The Prime Minister gives it a go and gives ten days for the strike. Vihaan leaves his desk job and leaves for Northern Command base in Udhampur . He requests Chief of the Army Staff General Arjun Singh Rajawat to count him in the operation to which he agrees. Vihaan chooses the elite Ghatak Force commandos from the Bihar Regiment , and the Dogra Regiment along with the special forces as most of the soldiers killed in the attack were from these regiments. Vihaan informs them that they can no longer use their phones and disguises the mission as regular training exercises. The commandos begin their training. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]

During the planning, Govind ropes in ISRO (for providing satellite images), DRDO (for drone surveillance), and RAW (for intelligence). When he goes to meet the DRDO Chief Brian D'Souza, he chances to meet an intern named Ishaan who has developed a drone called Garuda which looks and is shaped like an Eagle. [ 17 ] With the help of the drones and satellite images they can get the exact location of the hideouts and training camps of the terrorists. Jasmine reveals her true name as Pallavi Sharma to Vihaan, and during an interrogation, the two extract information about who planned the attack. He chooses Seerat to be his pilot, who agrees wholeheartedly. Govind also suggests intensifying the artillery shelling at the border for distraction and painting their assault helicopters with Pakistani Air Force markings. The commandos also start training under Vihaan. The Pakistani officials suspect the Indian activities but dismiss them due to underestimation.

On the night of 28 September, the commandos leave for the strike in Pakistan occupied Kashmir in Mi-17 helicopters. During the mission, Vihaan's helicopter is forced not to cross the Line of Control due to the latest intelligence from spies in Pakistan that the Pakistani Army has deployed an "" AWAC "" early warning radar-based surface to air missile system in Muzaffarabad sector to bring their helicopter down. He and his team improvise by going on foot through a cave (which was very risky due to darkness and the unknown presence of other terrorists). His team successfully infiltrate and kill all the terrorists on the two launchpads. Similarly, other commando teams also manage to kill all of the terrorists. Vihaan kills Idris and Jabbar, who are the perpetrators of the Uri attack. The local police are alerted, and the commandos who are low on ammunition and time escape. On their way back, they are heavily rained down upon by gunfire from both a nearby machine gun bunker and a Pakistani Air Force Mi-17 Helicopter, which was scrambled to intercept Vihaan's team. Flight Lieutenant Seerat comes to their rescue by firing back at the Pakistani gunship, thus driving it away and eliminating the machine gun bunker. His team successfully crosses the LoC on the Indian side with no casualties. The rest of the assigned teams are also successful and are back with no casualties. Vihaan lands at Hindon Air Force Station at Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh . The film ends with him, Pallavi, Govind, and the commandos happily having a formal dinner with the Prime Minister.

In a post-credits scene, Zameer, a Pakistani minister, wakes up and shouts in frustration while seeing the news of India's successful surgical strike. The scene cuts to a title card reading "" Jai Hind "".

Uri was announced by producer Ronnie Screwvala one year after the surgical strike in September 2017. The film was to be directed by debutant Aditya Dhar. He said that the film is ""the story of what was imagined to have happened in those eleven days."" [ 18 ] The principal photography began in June 2018 and was finished in September. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Kaushal went through extensive military training for five months and gained weight. He trained for five hours a day and three to four hours of military training to enhance stamina. He also received gun training at the naval base in Cuffe Parade in Mumbai. [ 21 ] He called it ""physically the most challenging film for me"". [ 22 ] He injured his arm while filming an action sequence in it. [ 23 ]

Kaushal and the supporting cast trained at Mumbai's Navy Nagar with Captains and Majors teaching them slithering, using arms and ammunitions and other drills used by the armed forces. [ 24 ] Uri was largely shot in Serbia and was wrapped up in Mumbai. [ 22 ] The Indo-Pak border, the LOC and other areas resembling military posts and terrorist camps were recreated in Serbia. [ 24 ] Yami Gautam underwent mixed martial arts training. [ 25 ] She called the process of shooting as ""exhausting yet enjoyable."" The film also stars Paresh Rawal , Mohit Raina , Ivan Rodrigues and Kirti Kulhari . [ 26 ] Screwvala said that the film has elements of ""war, action, and strategy based on a true story"" that the ""Indian audience is yet to watch such experience in cinema."" [ 27 ]

The film was released on 11 January 2019. [ 1 ] The film was digitally premiered on ZEE5 Platform on 19 March 2019. [ 28 ] To curtail piracy, the makers of Uri: The Surgical Strike deployed a 3.8 gigabyte fake version of the film over networks like torrent . [ 29 ] However, the film was leaked by the bootleg website Tamil Rockers within a week of release. [ 30 ] The Telugu dubbed version of the film was released with the same name on 14 June 2019.

The film score and songs were composed and produced by Shashwat Sachdev . Kumaar , Raj Shekhar and Abhiruchi Chand are the lyricists. [ 32 ]

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 57% of 14 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. [ 33 ] Namrata Joshi , writing for The Hindu , stated: ""Whichever side of the political divide one may stand, one can't dismiss Dhar's canniness and craft and Vicky Kaushal as the Army officer was brilliant.""
Amman Khurana of Times Now News , giving 4 stars out of 5, comments: ""Uri: The Surgical Strike is a rather mature film. It somehow knows that it is catering to the viewer that is tired of watching the men in uniform who thump their chests to show their love and passion for the country."" He further has to say: ""The stunning cinematography and the VFX work ensure that Uri: The Surgical Strike does not pass off as a comic-book account of the operation."" He concludes: ""Uri: The Surgical Strike is a good one-time watch. If not for anything else, watch it for Vicky Kaushal, who brings the right amount of intensity to his role and drives the film from start to finish."" [ 34 ] Taran Adarsh rated the film 4 stars out of 5, says ""Uri is one film that *should* be watched… Absorbing screenplay, superbly executed combat scenes, efficient direction Aditya Dhar… Uri is thrilling, gripping, instils patriotism, without getting jingoistic."" [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Rajeev Masand of News 18 gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, ""Vicky Kaushal is in especially good form as the protagonist, looking every bit the army man. He brings both the bulked-up physicality and the sort of steely determination that the part requires."" [ 37 ]

Anupama Chopra of Film Companion said, ""The film alternates between fact and fiction, between gritty re-creations of combat and Top Gun -style, slow-motion shots of soldiers getting out of helicopters. For the first half, Aditya manages this tight-rope walk efficiently, aided by the strong work of DOP Mitesh Mirchandani. The story-telling has the scale and the narrative beats are predictable but satisfying"", but found the plot simplistic in places. [ 38 ] Raja Sen of Hindustan Times gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and said, ""Uri is a very good looking film — though the cinematographer appears to have been told to highlight the lens-flare in every single shot of nighttime combat — and while the action is totally brilliant.""

Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola,tt2106537,"The film tells the story of three individuals, Harphool Singh Mandola a.k.a. Harry, his daughter Bijlee Mandola, and Hukum Singh Matru a.k.a. 'Matru'. Harry is a wealthy, cynical businessman who dreams of turning the Mandola village into an example of his success. However, this dream can only be realized if the villagers agree to sell their land to the government at low rates so that the land can be converted into a Special Economic Zone.

Harry is a drunkard. He is normally a shrewd, sophisticated and composed individual, but whenever drunk, he turns into an advocate of equality and betterment of the villagers. When he chooses not to drink, he hallucinates, a pink buffalo 'Gulabo/Aditi Arora', the mascot of the brand of alcohol he enjoys. When Matru learns of these hallucinations, he uses them as a ploy to get Harry drunk and serve his own plans.

Bijlee Mandola is the only child of Harry Mandola. She lost her mother when she was young and now lives in Mandola village after having received a higher education in New Delhi and later in Oxford, England. Bijlee is now in love with Baadal, the son of politician Chaudhari Devi and is all set to marry him.

Chaudhari Devi is a corrupt politician who, along with her minions, is helping Harry realize his dream. Baadal and Bijlee's union is strategically apt as it serves Harry's and Chaudhari Devi's personal goals. While Chaudhari Devi conspires to control Harry's wealth by marrying her son to his daughter, Harry seeks Chaudhari Devi's help in realising his dream in exchange for their children's marriage.

Matru is a revolutionary, fighting for the villagers' cause of not letting their land being taken away. He is educated in Law from JNU, holds a job as Harry's driver and is responsible for regulating Harry's drinking. Matru's revolutionary instincts are shown to be significantly influenced by those of Mao Tse-tung .

The film starts with a negotiation at a liquor shop set in crop laden fields, between the liquor shop owner and a heavily drunk Harry. The shop owner's rude refusal to sell alcohol to Harry due to the day being a dry day provokes Harry to run his limousine into the shop.

Once drunk, Harry is shown to be an entirely different individual, who wants the land of the villagers to be returned to them, Matru to marry Bijlee while himself to retire into a religious man.

The villagers, in their fight are supported and advised by Mao who regularly sends messages to the villagers, written on cloth. Later in the film it is revealed that Mao is none other than Matru who is advising the villagers without revealing himself in order to retain the key position as Harry's aide.

Bijlee's love for Baadal is depicted to be a contradiction to her subtle, probably subconscious, knowledge of Baadal's incompatibility with her. This subtle thought aggravated by Baadal's affiliation and deeds supporting his mother's corrupt cause overpowers Bijlee's will to marry him and polarizes her into helping Matru and the villagers instead. After this polarization, seeing Chaudhari Devi and Baadal's ambitions in a new light and while helping the villagers along with Matru, Bijlee falls in love with Matru.

Although they have the help of Matru, his college friends, and Bijlee, the villagers lose their entire harvest to an unexpected rain storm. This harvest, which would have fetched enough money to settle their debts to the government bank and some more for their own survival, is now completely destroyed. Thus the villagers are forced to surrender their land, against their will, to the government in order to settle their debts.

Later, discovering Bijlee's alliance with the villagers, Chaudhari Devi, now cautious, decides to finalize the decree to convert the now acquired land into an SEZ only once Bijlee and Baadal are married.

These conflicts of villagers' loss of their lands, Bijlee's marriage to Baadal, builds up the tension leading up to the wedding at the climax wherein Matru and the villagers have a plan to get Harry drunk who will then call off the wedding. This plan apparently works and Harry is shown to be drunk, succumbing to Matru and the villagers' plan. Now, while drunk, he enters the wedding venue, calls off the wedding, and chases away Chaudhari Devi whilst Baadal and their supporters and decides to get Bijlee and Matru married. Consequently, upon refusal by Matru on the pretext that Harry will not feel the same way about him and Bijlee when sober, Harry, to everyone's surprise, reveals that since he had sworn on Bijlee to not consume even a drop of alcohol has stood by his word, in turn revealing that while he did all that he did appearing to be drunk, he was completely sober instead.

The film's music was composed by Vishal Bhardwaj with lyrics by Gulzar . The soundtrack was released by Sony Music India . The title song, by Sukhwinder Singh and Ranjit Barot , was released as a single track on 30 November 2012.

Aarakshan,tt1848771,"In 2008, Deepak Kumar ( Saif Ali Khan ), an MSc topper, is at an interview for the teacher's post at an affluent school. The interviewers turn him down when they discover his low-caste roots. Deepak relates the incident to his mentor, Dr. Prabhakar Anand ( Amitabh Bachchan ). Dr. Anand, the legendary principal of renowned STM college, where Deepak studied, offers Deepak an interim job as a teacher at STM. Deepak is comforted by his friend, Sushant ( Prateik Babbar ), an upper-caste boy, and his girlfriend, Poorvi ( Deepika Padukone ), who is Dr. Anand's daughter.

The state minister, Baburam, wishes to enroll his no-good nephew at STM. Dr. Anand, however, turns him down. The minister decides to install his own man, Dr. Mithilesh Singh ( Manoj Bajpayee ), on the STM college board. Cunning and greedy, Mithilesh seeks only to enrich himself. The minister's ambition is to build a multi-billion-dollar educational conglomerate and plans to use Mithilesh's outside business—a coaching class—for it.

The Supreme Court grants reservations for other backward classes. A large crowd of STM students, boisterously celebrating the ruling, arrive at the gates of STM and create a ruckus. Sushant gathers a group of upper-caste boys and tries to drive off the revellers. Dr. Anand hauls Deepak and Sushant but is shocked to find that Deepak has turned on him. Poorvi later confronts Deepak and asks him to apologise to her father, but he refuses, leading to their breakup.

The backward classes welcome reservations because they provide additional education opportunities. The upper classes are against reservations because they do not believe in the effectiveness of the reservation system. These arguments are played out between Sushant and Deepak. The moderate STM administrators are afraid that college-level reservations may create conflicts between the students. When asked by a reporter, Dr. Anand shares his personal opinion – that some form of reservation, free of politics and economics, is good for society. The next day's headlines scream that Dr. Anand favours reservations. The STM board is outraged; Dr. Anand is warned that Mithilesh will use this to oust him. Dr. Anand resigns from STM, and Mithilesh is appointed as the new principal. Sushant soon realizes that Dr. Anand's intention is not bad and that he does not have caste feelings.

Dr. Anand, to his shock, finds that his house is being used for K.K. coaching classes, which is linked to Mithilesh. Earlier, Dr. Anand had signed as a guarantor for the bank loan taken by his friend, allowing his friend's sons to stay in that house for 2 years. However, they used it to earn money by allowing K.K. coaching classes inside the house. Dr. Anand's house lands in a civil court case, and no lawyer is ready to go against Mithilesh. Meanwhile, Deepak, who is in the United States, finds that Dr. Anand has resigned from STM and immediately comes to India. An enraged Deepak goes to that house and takes the law into his own hands by trying to evacuate people related to K.K. coaching classes. Police arrest Deepak, but later Deepak gets released on bail by Sushant.

Dr. Anand resolves to take out Mithilesh with the only weapon left: teaching. He approaches his friend, Shambhu the cowherd, and takes shelter at the tabela (cowshed). He begins teaching small groups of needy and backward students from the bastee (nearby neighbourhood), at the cowshed. His first success is Muniya ( Aanchal Munjal ), Shambhu's daughter, who comes in first place in the board exam. Muniya's principal offers to send more students to Dr. Anand's Tabela school. Deepak and Sushant return to Dr. Anand and join forces, teaching at the Tabela school. The Tabela students fare much better in exams than their classmates. The Tabela school's reputation grows and begins to draw away students from Mithilesh's coaching class.

Mithilesh responds by obtaining a legal permit to demolish the cowshed. The situation is diffused by the arrival of Shakuntala Tai, the reclusive magnate who started the STM institutions. She calls the chief minister , who promptly averts the destruction of the cowshed. Mithilesh is dismissed, and Dr. Anand is reinstated as the chief trustee of the STM and lifelong principal of the newly created STM Remedial Center.

Shooting began on 15 January 2011. Director Prakash Jha finished casting but the male lead was not finalised. Ajay Devgan was first considered for the role, however Ajay had many other projects in hand, including Golmaal 3 and Singham . So Jha decided to cast Saif Ali Khan . Khan found it very hard to juggle between two films at once because he had to learn Sanskrit for his role in the film. Bachchan and Saif Ali Khan learnt teaching skills in mathematics from Bihar 's Super 30 founder Anand Kumar . [ 3 ] Most of the film's shooting took place in Minal Residency, Oriental College , Upper Lake in Bhopal . The shooting finished in early March 2011.

Aarakshan mostly garnered mixed to positive reviews. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated it with 4 stars and said – ""On the whole, Aarakshan communicates an engaging story with very relatable characters. It's a movie that is truly inspiring and thought-provoking, but at the same time, its running time [almost 2.45 hours] is a deterrent.(...) Aarakshan not only works as a film, but also as a tool to drive home a forceful message. It's a daring, heroic, commanding and an engaging film that shouldn't be missed!"". He also praised the performance of the leads. [ 4 ] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave it 3 stars and said – ""Sad. Because as a film on the issue of reservation, Aarakshan was rocking till the first half. But as an omnibus on the travails of India's education system, it flounders into no-man's land. Watch it for the intermittent high drama and the gritty performances, scattered as they are."" [ 5 ] Shivesh Kumar of IndiaWeekly awarded the movie 3 out of 5 stars. [ 6 ] Dainik Bhaskar awarded three stars in their review and wrote – ""Watch it for the conflicts between the characters and an outstanding performance by Amitabh Bachchan. On the flipside, if you expect drama and finesse that you witnessed in Prakash Jha's last release 'Rajneeti', you will be disappointed."" [ 7 ] Vandana Krishnan from Behindwoods rated it 1.5/5 and said that the film represents ""Great bottle bad wine"" further citing ""Overall, the film falls short of the expectations the trailer, start cast and story had created."" [ 8 ] Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars and said: ""Given all the pre-release brouhaha over its emotive subject matter (leading to several states banning its public screening), Aarakshan is quite a copout. It ends up being more about the depredations of the nation’s education mafia than the vexed question of job and college quotas for backward caste candidates and its fallout. The basic premise is rooted in the real world all right and the film might touch some raw nerves. But the dramatisation of the conflict over the quota raj that divides India down the middle tends to border on the excessively shrill, if not completely shallow."" [ 9 ] Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chairman Leela Samson said that Aarakshan was a good film about education but ""unfortunately hit troubled political situations"". [ 10 ] The controversial film has received a compliment from unlikely quarters in Chhattisgarh with the state Scheduled Tribes Commission seeking a tax-free status for the Amitabh Bachchan starrer. [ 11 ]

Sukanya Venkatraghavan of Filmfare gave it 2 stars out of 5, stating ""The problem with Aarakshan is its meandering graph. It starts off solidly enough, keeping up a pace that will engross you until interval time except for two totally unnecessary songs. From there on, the film sheds its theme of ideals and becomes a one on one contest that, to put it really tritely, is a tug of war between two coaching classes. The dialogue is strong and opinionated and actors like Saif Ali Khan and Manoj Bajpai do everything to get you to like the film (...)Aarakshan has all the right intentions but it is a tad confusing in its stance. Of course ultimately it shows the triumph of selfless dedication to the cause of education and there is no faulting that. One does walk away with some reservations though."" [ 12 ] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 2 out of 5 stars, calling it ""a deathly boring slog"" and adding: ""With so much to say, the movie drags on endlessly, with over-written scenes, over-the-top emotions and dialogues that are so heavy, they end up being inaccessible. Of the performances, every actor seems to go through the motions and only Manoj Bajpai inserts some spark onto the screen. 'Aarakshan' is well-intentioned, but you can't shake off the feeling that you're trapped by a three-hour-long tirade. I'm going with a generous two out of five for Prakash Jha's 'Aarakshan'. If you don't want to be lectured, stay at home."" [ 13 ]

Aarakshan released in 1085 cinemas across India. [ 14 ] The film saw 50–70% occupancy on its first day of release, while in Delhi, it opened at around 60–70%. [ 15 ] The film's business was affected due to the bans imposed on its screening in Punjab, UP and Andhra. It went on to collect Rs 44.7 million on the first day.

The soundtrack features the vocal talents of Mohit Chauhan , Shreya Ghoshal , Mahalakshmi Iyer , Raman Mahadevan , Shankar Mahadevan and classical singer Channulal Mishra . The concept of the song ""Kaun Si Dor"" was from Prasoon Joshi , the songwriter of the album who came up with the first lines of the song. The trio then went on to develop the song and roped in Channulal Mishra , who agreed to sing the song as per their request. The soundtrack was released on 11 July 2011.

The film score was composed by Wayne Sharpe.

Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews from the critics. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood hungama gave it 2 out of 5 stars and said: ""Aarakshan doesn't boast of the kind of score that has in it to make waves commercially since almost all songs mainly have a situational appeal to them. Yes, at least 'Achha Lagta Hai' is good that prevents Aarakshan from becoming totally forgettable. However despite low expectations from the soundtrack here, the end result is far more being satisfactory."" [ 24 ] ""Mauka"" was voted the best song in IRDS Film awards 2011 by Institute for Research and Documentation in Social Sciences (IRDS), a Lucknow-based Civil society for depicting the contradictory positions being taken on reservation by its opponents and supporters [ 25 ]

In early May 2011, civic authorities in Bhopal bulldozed the sets of Aarakshan because it was erected on disputed land. [ 27 ]

Some pro-Dalit groups in Kanpur protested Saif Ali Khan being cast in the role of a Dalit . [ 28 ] They objected to the actor's royal background and saw his role of a so-called Dalit as an insult to the community. [ 29 ]

The film was banned in Uttar Pradesh , Punjab and Andhra Pradesh before its theatrical release. The Punjab government banned the film on fears that certain scenes and dialogues in the film may inflame the passion of some communities in Punjab. [ 30 ] Mayawati government banned the film in UP for two months on grounds that it could create law and order problem in the state. [ 31 ]

National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) viewed the movie after getting complaints of its objectionable content. ""While the overall theme of the film is not objectionable, it is loaded with anti-Dalit and anti-reservation dialogues,"" said NCSC chairman P.L. Punia. However, the Board, which granted the film a U/A certification, said it would defend Jha's right to free expression. [ 32 ] In reply to this, the director decided to remove 'objectionable' scenes from the film in a bid to prevent further backlash. [ 33 ] Prakash Jha and producers of Aarakshan moved the Supreme Court to lift the ban on the film in the three states. [ 34 ] Supreme Court lifted the ban on Aarakshan in Uttar Pradesh later. [ 35 ]

Apart from the aforementioned announced bans, there was an unexpected mid screening ban on the film in the multiplexes of Gurgaon, on the night of its release. [ 36 ]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Aarakshan.jpg/220px-Aarakshan.jpg
Bbuddah... Hoga Terra Baap,tt1869296,"ACP Karan has declared that he will eliminate all gangsters from Mumbai within two months. In response, gangster Kabir Bhai decides to eliminate Karan instead. Enter Vijju, a seasoned hitman who refuses to acknowledge his advancing age , returning to Mumbai after a long exile in Paris , France, to complete one last job.

While the gangsters and Vijju attempt to take down Karan, the ACP is simultaneously trying to woo his old college friend Tanya. Meanwhile, Tanya's friend Amrita is attempting to unravel the mysterious relationship between Vijju and her mother, suspecting they might have had an affair years ago due to her mother's overly friendly demeanor towards Vijju.

Vijju later reveals a shocking truth: he is not a contract killer but is actually trying to protect his son, ACP Karan. He explains that he was once a gangster, and his rowdy lifestyle ultimately led to his separation from his wife, Sita, and subsequently from his son. Karan was unaware of his father's identity, as his mother had never mentioned him. Vijju also clarifies that he did not have an affair with Amrita's mother.

Despite meeting his estranged wife Sita, Vijju fails to reconcile their relationship. However, Karan successfully wins over Tanya and her conservative father. Tragedy strikes when Tedha shoots Karan, despite Vijju's attempts to prevent the confrontation. A wounded and furious Vijju admits Karan to the hospital and then visits Kabir's den.

After reciting a short story and explaining three morals, Vijju informs the gangsters that Karan is alive and that the den is surrounded by police, accusing Tedha of being an undercover officer. A fierce shootout ensues, during which Vijju kills most of the confused gangsters, leaving only Kabir and his aide Mac alive.

Kabir kills Tedha, believing him to be a traitor. He is then surprised to learn that Vijju is Karan's father and that Tedha was not an undercover officer. Vijju shoots Kabir in the head but spares Mac. At the hospital, Vijju finally acknowledges his age and reconciles with Sita, asking her whether he should reveal his identity to Karan.

Sita forbids him from doing so, and Vijju decides to return to Paris, with the understanding that Sita will bring Karan to him when she is ready.

The director Jagannadh wanted to hire three leading heroines for the movie, which was originally titled Buddah . Finally he zeroed down on Hema Malini , Raveena Tandon and Charmy Kaur , an actress from South India who will be making her Bollywood debut in this movie. [ 2 ] Actress Neha Sharma was also interested in doing Kaur's role, but eventually the role went to Kaur. [ 2 ] Tandon later said that she signed the movie to work with Bachchan and Jagannadh. [ 3 ] For another role in the movie, both Sonal Chauhan and Kangana Ranaut were in discussion, but eventually the role went to Chauhan. [ 4 ]

The 'mahurat' shot of the movie was done in March 2011 at Khoja Bungalow in Versova. While Jagannadh broke the coconut, actor Sonu Sood featured in the mahurat shot.

Raja Sen of Rediff gave it four out of five stars and stated, ""Bbuddah Hoga Tera Baap is not a particularly well-crafted film, but none of that matters as Amitabh Bachchan makes it work."" [ 10 ] Nikhat Kazmi from the Times of India gave a three and a half stars and stated, ""Bbuddah... is a high dose entertainer when the veteran actor never stops amazing you with the range of his histrionics. Despite his age, he grabs eyeballs with his action cuts, his comic cameos, his romantic ditties (with Hema), his libidinous encounters (with Raveena), his emotional bytes, his derring-do, and his over-the top sartorial sense."" [ 11 ] Taran Adarsh gave a four out of five stars and noted, ""On the whole, Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap is a must-watch for Bachchan fans. Even if you're not a fan of this iconic actor, watch it for a simple reason: They don't make them like Amitabh Bachchan anymore. A masala entertainer all the way. Bachchan is truly the Baap, and this film reiterates this fact yet again. His character, his attitude and the dialogue he delivers will remain etched in your memory for a long, long time. Prakash Raj is super. In fact, it's a treat to watch powerful actors like Bachchan and Prakash Raj embroiled in a confrontation."" [ 12 ]

Filmfare gave a four star rating and said, ""Bbuddah... Hoga Terra Baap is a feast for Amitabh Bachchan buffs. The film ends with a disclaimer saying it's a tribute to the phenomenon, and that says it all."" [ 13 ] Zee News also gave four stars and stated,""‘Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap' is a typical Bollywood masala flick with all the ingredients to make it a Box Office hit. An out-an-out Amitabh Bachchan film, 'Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap' presents Big B in never before seen role, something which reminds you of the exhilarating performance of the iconic star in his earlier films."" [ 14 ] Sify gave a two and a half star rating and explained, ""Big B's presence is so overwhelming he makes the character— a violent, unlikable one—into a somewhat charismatic one. The altercations between Bachchan and the villain (Prakash Raj, fab) are to watch out for, especially towards the end. Also worth savoring are the Amitabh-Hema portions, where they create magic momentarily. It's an average story with archaic storytelling. If you're watching it, keep in mind that Big B is the only thing going for the film."" [ 15 ] Komal Nahta of Koimoi gave it 2 stars. [ 16 ]

The domestic opening weekend collection were around ₹ 85 million (US$1.0 million).

Dear Zindagi,tt5946128,"Kaira, a young and ambitious cinematographer in Mumbai , aspires to direct her own films. Though creatively driven, she is emotionally guarded and often cynical, finding comfort primarily in her close-knit group of friends—Fatima, Jackie, Raunaq, and Ganju. Her personal life becomes increasingly complicated when she ends her relationship with her childhood sweetheart Sid and begins a brief affair with her friend Raghuvendra, a film producer . The situation worsens when Raghuvendra gets engaged to another woman. Shortly after, Kaira is evicted from her apartment due to the building society's policy favoring families and married couples.

With no other option, Kaira relocates to her family home in Goa , despite longstanding emotional distance and unresolved resentment towards her parents. Plagued by insomnia and inner turmoil, she reluctantly begins therapy with Dr. Jehangir ""Jug"" Khan, an unconventional and empathetic psychologist . As their sessions progress, Jug helps Kaira confront her suppressed insecurities and fears. Meanwhile, she initiates a relationship with Rumi, a charming musician , but ends it upon realizing their incompatibility.

Through therapy and reconnection with her younger brother Kiddo, Kaira gradually confronts the root of her emotional struggles—her feelings of abandonment stemming from being left with her grandparents during her childhood while her parents rebuilt their lives, and then bursts into tears. Jug helps her understand that this abandonment has caused her to fear emotional attachment and preemptively end relationships to avoid getting hurt. He encourages her to view her parents as flawed individuals rather than idealized caregivers, thereby empowering her to begin the process of emotional reconciliation.

During their final session, Kaira admits that she has developed feelings for Jug. He gently explains that it is not uncommon for patients to feel this way toward their therapists, but a romantic relationship between them would be unethical. The two part on amicable terms, sharing a warm farewell.

Kaira eventually completes her short film and debuts it at a screening attended by her family, friends, and former partners. Having come to terms with her past, she opens herself to new possibilities, initiating a conversation with a furniture designer at the event—signaling a renewed sense of self and emotional openness.

Dear Zindagi marked the second directorial venture of Gauri Shinde following her acclaimed debut English Vinglish (2012). The film was jointly produced by Gauri Khan under Red Chillies Entertainment , Karan Johar under Dharma Productions , and Shinde under her banner Hope Productions. Speaking about the film’s inspiration, Shinde stated that Dear Zindagi was not based on any singular personal experience but was “inspired by life in general,” particularly the emotional connections people form and how those influence their worldview. [ 8 ] By August 2015, Shinde confirmed she had nearly completed the screenplay, [ 9 ] and pre-production work began in December of the same year.

Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive,tt5313980,"The story focuses on a director, Sharma, whose father owns a sweetshop and wants his son to work there. Sharma, however, wants to become a director, so he leaves for Mumbai to fulfill his dreams. While traveling in the bus, he meets Paddi Singh who notices that his face strongly resembles Osama Bin Laden's. With a new idea in mind, Singh takes him to the film producers called the Shetty Sisters, who offer opportunities to newcomers. After hearing Singh's idea, and particularly upon seeing Paddi, they are impressed.

After the film Tere Bin Laden starring Ali Zafar becomes a blockbuster, Ali embarrasses both Sharma and Paddi. Sharma wants to make the sequel to the film, but Shetty Sisters decide not to help him as Ali wants the sequel to be produced by Karan Johar . This causes a fight between Ali and Sharma. Paddi intervenes and tells the Shetty Sisters that he will do the sequel on the condition it's produced by Sharma with Ali not as the lead actor. Shetty Sisters decide to fire Ali. Everyone involved has doubts and confusion on how can the film will perform without a renowned actor. Once shooting starts, a blunder happens; Osama dies. Thus, shooting stops as they lose confidence in the film. Shetty Sisters continuously demand their money be returned although Sharma has already spent it all. Meanwhile, USA president Obama, who has assassinated Osama, must prove the assassination to the people while lacking proof. They accidentally see Paddi on TV and concoct a plan to record video of his assassination as evidence. David DoSomething disguises himself as David Chadda, visits Paddi and offers him a role in a Hollywood film. Paddi, however, will only do the film on the condition Sharma directs it. Chadda agrees and tells them that the next day their driver will come pick them up.

Elsewhere, we are introduced to Khalili, owner of a terrorist organization and a business of selling guns and bombs. Due to financial crunches, the quality of the equipment is poor and causes his people to rebel. He amends the situation by promising free food and a film of Osama's adventures. During this film, a scene appears of Paddi and Khalili being informed that Osama is dead. Khalili plans to bring Paddi and have him reassure his people that he is the best supplier of bombing equipment and guns. He then orders his men to kidnap the cast of TBL . Their first target is Ali Zafar, but they fail to abduct him due to his ""Six Pack Abs"". Changing course, they set on kidnapping Paddi.

Khalili's men arrive before the driver sent by David picks them up. Sharma and Paddi, under the impression this was the driver sent by David, enters the car and is unknowingly kidnapped by Khalili's men.

When Chada learns of these circumstances, he travels to Khalili's place and rescues the cast of Tere bin Ladin. Chada now wants to capture a video portraying Osama (Paddi) being shot by the American army. When Sharma becomes aware of Chada's efforts, he makes a deal with him and Khalili. Chadda pays Khalili the money he's demanded while Sharma creates a ""proof movie"" in which Osama (Paddi) is shot by Obama. Obama then assures Sharma he can ask for any favors. Sharma says, ""One Hollywood movie"". In the end, that movie is shown to be Tora Bora Nights .

Waiting (2015 film),tt4818930,"Shiv Natraj ( Naseeruddin Shah ), an elderly psychology professor, arrives at a hospital in Kochi to visit his comatose wife Pankaja ( Suhasini Maniratnam ). Tara Kapoor Deshpande ( Kalki Koechlin ), a young advertising agent, also arrives at the hospital during the night after being delivered news of a car accident involving her husband, Rajat Deshpande ( Arjun Mathur ). She is consoled by Rajat's eccentric co-worker Girish (Rajeev Ravindranathan), but dismisses him abruptly. Tara is deeply disturbed to see Rajat breathing on a ventilator, and leaves immediately.

In the waiting lounge, Tara approaches Shiv, believing him to be a doctor, and asks for his advice. He reveals that his wife had a stroke eight months ago while he was out watching a cricket match, and has been in a coma ever since. The two bond over their similar situations. Later, Girish drops Tara off at a hotel and gives her Rajat's bag. Tara finds his watch in it and puts it on. The next day she is angered after reading an intimate message on Rajat's phone from a colleague Sheetal, who is later revealed to be a man. Shiv witnesses the whole misunderstanding, and the two share a light moment. He later visits her at the hotel, and she shares her disappointment with her friends and followers on social media for having abandoned her. She commends Shiv for his composure, as he explains the five stages of grief to her.

Tara finds her strength in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start spending most of their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra ( Rajat Kapoor ), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat would not want to take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.

Tara's best friend Ishita (Ratnabali Bhattacharjee) arrives at Kochi and advises her to start chanting prayers and to inform Rajat's estranged parents of his situation. Despite being an atheist , Tara chants Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō when she is alone with Rajat. Shiv desperately attempts to convince Malhotra to perform a spinal decompression on his wife, but he disregards Shiv's research and refuses to proceed with surgery. Tara discusses Rajat's surgery with Ishita and decides not to go ahead with it, which further angers Malhotra. Ishita leaves to aid her ailing son. Tara realises that she is no longer Ishita's top priority, now that Ishita is married. Shiv and Tara make up and later that night dance together at Shiv's house, much to the amusement of his neighbours. They get upset thinking about their spouses and discuss what they meant to them, before falling asleep in the living room.

The next morning, Tara leaves early and decides to inform Rajat's mother. After Girish brings Tara the required insurance papers, she thanks him for always being there for her and apologises for being rude. She decides to go ahead with the surgery after all. Rajat is taken to surgery, and she holds his hand until they arrive at the operating room. Shiv, on the other hand, decides to take Pankaja off the ventilator and let his wife herself make the final call. Pankaja tries to breathe on her own as the viewers are treated with flashbacks of the heyday of both couples. Tara takes a seat in the waiting lounge, and is joined by Shiv as the camera pans out.

Made on a modest budget, the movie, Waiting was produced by Priti Gupta of Ishka Films and Manish Mundra of Drishyam Films . [ 3 ] The film was directed by Anu Menon, her second directorial work after the romantic comedy London, Paris, New York (2012). [ 4 ] She also co-wrote the script with fellow London Film School alumnus and former anesthesiologist James Ruzicka. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Menon, inspired by her own personal experience, started working on the film's script with Ruzicka. She called the writing process extremely difficult as they had to figure out ""what it means to be associated with a comatose patient, both emotionally and medically"". She said later that Ruzicka's experience as a medical practitioner proved really helpful in developing a logical understanding of the situation. [ 7 ] Menon revealed that she had begun writing the story years before the actual production for the film began, and that it took her several years to complete it. [ 8 ]

Pre-production work began in July 2014, when Mundra, a Dubai -based film producer, agreed to produce. [ 8 ] Menon wanted an entirely different setting for the film, away from ""fast paced city life"", and decided to set the story in the South Indian state of Kerala . [ 8 ] The film's director of photography was cinematographer Neha Parti Martyani, who had been previously associated with films including My Name Is Khan (2010) and Yamla Pagla Deewana (2011). [ 9 ] The film's dialogue was written by Atika Chohan. Prajakta Ghag was the film's production designer . [ 9 ]

Entertainment website Bollywood Hungama reported that Kalki Koechlin was set to star in Menon's upcoming film. The published reports revealed that Koechlin would be playing the role of the young, brash, and social-media-savvy Tara Deshpande. [ 10 ] Koechlin's co-star from That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), Naseeruddin Shah, joined the cast after he was approached by Menon, who sent him the film's script in an e-mail. Shah, who did not have any prior knowledge of Menon's work, accepted the male lead role in the film. [ 11 ] To prepare for the role, Koechlin worked on the dialect in which her character spoke, an amalgamation of Hindi and English . [ 12 ] She also dyed her hair black for the role, as Menon wanted her to look more ""earthy"". [ 13 ] In an interview with Gulf News , Koechlin said she loved the film's vibe and compared it to the American drama Lost In Translation (2003). [ 14 ] In a separate e-mail interview with Arti Daniel of The Khaleej Times , Shah said that Waiting was his way of making up to the audience for the spate of ""ghastly movies"" that he did in 2014. [ 15 ]

South Indian actress and director Suhasini Maniratnam made her debut in Hindi cinema with Waiting ; she was cast in the role of Pankaja, Shah's character's wife. Menon talked about her experience working with Suhasini saying, ""With her experience, she also helped me with a few difficult scenes behind the camera."" [ 16 ] Arjun Mathur played the role of Rajat Deshpande, Tara's husband, who is involved in a car accident; Rajat Kapoor played Nirupam Malhotra, a doctor at the Kochi Hospital. [ 17 ] Ratnabali Bhatachajee, Rajeev Ravindranathan and Marin Babu played supporting roles in the film. The rest of the film's supporting cast consisted mainly of Malayali actors, including Dinesh Nair and Krishna Sankar, who were signed up with assistance from Gautam Pisharody, a local casting agent. [ 8 ]

Principal photography began in November 2014 in the coastal city of Kochi , Kerala. [ 8 ] The shoot for the entire film was completed on schedule in around 30 days. [ 16 ] [ 18 ] Of the shooting experience, Menon said, ""The experience was beautiful though there were many challenges as we were predominantly an all-woman crew."" [ 8 ] In an interview with The Hindu , Koechlin revealed that throughout the production process, she questioned Menon several times as she wanted to better understand her character's background. [ 19 ] She said that she would have lengthy discussions regarding particular scenes with Menon, who would then redraft the part. She also enjoyed working with Shah, describing the experience as ""gratifying"". [ 19 ]

The team of editors for Waiting was headed by Apurva Asrani and Nitin Baid. The sound mixing was done by London-based sound engineer Roland Heap, with assistance from Mandar Kamalapurkar and Udit Daseja. [ 9 ] Prajakta Ghag was the film's Production Designer and the marketing department was headed by Parull Gosain. [ 20 ] The editing process for the film took place in March 2015. [ 21 ] The film's final cut ran for a total of 98  minutes. [ 20 ]

Menon talked to The National about the film prior to its release, saying that the story was close to her heart as it was inspired by her own personal experience. On working with Koechlin and Shah she said, ""He (Shah) was punctual and always prepared, he gave his best performance in the first take. Kalki allows herself to be vulnerable. She is more porous and chilled out."" Menon acknowledged the chemistry of the leading duo and said that they were committed to the project and non-demanding. She described Waiting as a ""gentle and poignant film"" and said, ""It would make the audiences want to reach out to the leading characters and help them find their answers."" [ 16 ]

The film's music was composed by Mikey McCleary , with Kavita Seth , Nikhil D'Souza, Anushka Manchanda , Vishal Dadlani and McCleary serving as vocalists for the album. The tracks' lyrics were written by McCleary, Koechlin Manoj Muntashir , and Ankur Tewari. [ 22 ] The first song on the album, ""Tu Hai Toh Main Hoon"", a pop ballad by Manchanda and D'Souza, was released on YouTube on 4 May 2016. [ 23 ] The album consisted of three other songs; McCleary's ""Got My Eyes For You"", Manchanda's ""Waiting For You"", and Seth and Dadlani's ""Zara Zara"". [ 24 ] The complete soundtrack for Waiting was released on 16 May 2016, under the Zee Music Company label. [ 22 ] [ 25 ]

The film's soundtrack was well received by critics. The tracks ""Tu Hai Toh Main Hoon"" and ""Zara Zara"" garnered positive response from critics and audiences alike; Manavi Kapoor of Business Standard remarked, "" ' Zara Zara' and 'Tu Hai Toh Main Hun' are haunting and perfectly capture the poignant tone of the film."" [ 26 ] Ushnota Paul writing for Filmfare was also laudatory of both the songs, as each ""lingers with you for long"". [ 27 ] In another soundtrack review for The Times of India , Mohar Basu praised McCleary's ""trademark effervescence"", which made the soundtrack of Waiting ""oh-so-charming."" She summed up by writing that the album had, ""a few pleasant songs and even though they all sound fairly similar, it has a satisfying effect"". [ 22 ] Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in gave a mixed review; he was analogous in the praise of the ""pleasant"" nature of the tracks, but was critical of the lyrics that didn't go beyond the ""greeting-card sentiment"". [ 24 ]

Waiting had its world premiere on 11 December 2015 at the 12th edition of the Dubai International Film Festival . [ 28 ] There the film's executive producer Priti Gupta, founder of Ishka Films, emphasised the universality of the film and said, ""It is an endearing and beautiful movie for not just Indian[s], but the world audience, as it is essentially about the universal human circumstances, which are deftly portrayed in a tender yet humorous way."" [ 29 ] Manish Mundra, founder of Drishyam Films , expressed his delight at the screening of the film, acknowledging that Dubai was one of the biggest overseas markets for Indian films. The film was also screened at the closing gala of the London Asian Film Festival , and at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles . [ 30 ] [ 31 ]

The official trailer for Waiting was released on 22 April 2016 to positive response from both critics and audience alike. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Rajani Chandel of The Times of India asserted that it ""will move you to tears"", while The Huffington Post India editor Ankur Pathak noted the leading duo's ""effortlessly comfortable vibe"", and dubbed the trailer ""lovely"". [ 34 ] [ 33 ] Menon talked about the challenges of promoting an independent film and attracting viewers saying, ""The distribution is first weekend collection driven [...] Those depending on a buzz created by word of mouth are at a disadvantage."" [ 35 ] The film had a special screening prior to its theatrical release which was attended by the cast and crew and other Bollywood celebrities including: Gulshan Devaiah , Radhika Apte , Huma Qureshi , Rajkummar Rao and Adil Hussain . [ 36 ] It had its theatrical release on 27 May 2016 in India. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ]

The film had a poor opening at the box office as the morning vacancy varied from 2 to 3 per cent in multiplexes. [ 40 ] The film managed to collect a mere ₹ 2.5 million (US$30,000) on its opening day. [ 41 ] It was released alongside other indie films including Veerappan and Phobia , both of which also had a relatively poor opening. However, Waiting showed good growth over the day with the best occupancy among the aforementioned films. [ 42 ] The numbers grew as the film collected ₹ 4.8 million (US$57,000) and ₹ 5.5 million (US$65,000) on its second and third day respectively, bringing the first weekend gross to a total of ₹ 12.8 million (US$150,000). [ 2 ] It carried on with steady numbers through the first and the second week collecting ₹ 25 million (US$300,000). [ 2 ] Waiting grossed a total of around ₹ 35 million (US$410,000) in its entire run at the box office. [ 2 ]

The film opened to largely positive reviews in India. [ 44 ] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film the highest praise and deemed it ""a well-chiselled marvel"" saying: "" Waiting is at once heart-wrenching and uplifting ... marked by deep philosophical undertones, but it is never unduly ponderous."" [ 45 ] A reviewer for The New Indian Express also spoke highly of the film saying, ""Not since Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox have I seen an indie film addressing itself to the ageless issue of human desolation and individual grief with such warmth, dignity, grace, honesty and humour."" [ 46 ] For Namrata Joshi of The Hindu , the script was ""dignified [and] without any false notes"", and the film managed ""to stand on its own emotional ground ... The people, situations, relationships, feelings are layered, warm and humorous, ringing true in their complexities."" [ 47 ] Mohar Basu of The Times of India called the film ""thought-provoking"" writing: ""Menon has whipped up a warm tale about love, loss and surviving life's catastrophic blows, with such simplicity."" [ 48 ]

Kunal Guha of the Mumbai Mirror lauded the film's direction and cinematography saying, ""Menon has the tenacity of a Sofia Coppola to produce frames where not much happens but one is unable to look away"", and concluded, ""The film deserves a watch for being one that doesn't try too hard and for its approach to an extreme situation."" [ 49 ] Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle , while also praising the technical expertise, said, ""Neha Parti Matiyani beautifully captures the beautiful city of Kochi"" and called the film ""unmissable"" saying, "" Waiting is a refreshing subject that is engaging enough right up till its open-ended climax."" [ 50 ] Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express thought that the film was ""too explanatory, too talky"", and that ""the most effective moments in the film occur when the two leads are allowed to fall silent, to just be in that moment, to loosen up"". While lauding the film's treatment of the subject matter, Gupta described Waiting as ""a film about life, lasting love and impending loss which explores a zone Bollywood doesn't bother with"". [ 51 ]

The performances of the leading pair of Koechlin and Shah were chiefly praised by several critics. Guha in his review remarked ""this film belongs to Kalki, who impresses by managing to wordlessly convey her character's state of mind in every scene"". [ 49 ] Chatterjee, offering a similar observation, wrote that Koechlin ""provides the ideal foil, adding immensely to the emotional depth of the tale and heightening the conflict between two unlike poles"". The latter thought that the lead performances empowered the film. [ 45 ] In her review for Rediff.com Sukanya Verma called the film ""absolutely riveting"", and wrote of Koechlin that ""[t]here's something stunningly unhindered about Kalki and her aura. She uses this quality in the most mesmeric fashion to create a woman we sympathise with and wish well for."" [ 52 ]

In her review for Firstpost , Anna M. M. Vetticad wrote that the leading pair ""shine in a lovely film"" noting that chemistry between them was ""unmistakable"". She concluded by saying, ""[ Waiting ] is both sad and amusing, believable, well acted and very well told"". [ 53 ] Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times summed up her review by writing, ""Packaged with Naseeruddin as the adorable old man ... and Kalki as the charming young, energetic woman, Waiting is a delight."" [ 54 ] While acknowledging the ""underdeveloped and overwritten"" parts of the plot, Gupta was nonetheless appreciative of Koechlin and Shah, calling them good fits for their roles. [ 51 ] Rajeev Masand writing for News18 offered similar observations; he criticized the ""weak"" plotting, but talked well of the characters: ""you yearn for them to just shut up and soak in the silence. Each time they do, the film soars."" Also lauding Shah's ""real"" and Koechlin's ""endearing"" performances, he wrote that Waiting , ""raises important questions about life, love, and letting go. Plus there are those two splendid performances. That's plenty to merit a viewing."" [ 55 ]

The film received positive reviews from critics at the Dubai International Film Festival who praised the story's narrative, Menon's direction, and the performances of the lead pairing of Koechlin and Shah. Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times called the film a ""tragic, witty affair"" and praised the humour of presenting the contrast between Shiv and Tara. [ 28 ] Fionnuala Halligan of Screen International lauded the cinematography and Neha Parti Mtiyani's ""dignified lenswork"" and wrote further, "" Waiting simmers in its locales without being brash or boastful; the colours of India are there, glowing at the sidelines."" She also lauded Koechlin's and Shah's performances saying that the film ""benefits greatly from Koechlin's appeal ... she has an expressive face to match her talent"" and added that Shah's presence ""lends the film its grace-notes"". [ 56 ] Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter also gave it a positive review calling the film: ""A tender, often humorous tale with sparkling performances."" In her opinion, ""Koechlin does an exceptional job navigating the shoals of this as a kooky drama queen"" while ""Shah brings great feeling and complexity to the role of the wise, tolerant Shiv.""
